\arguments{
\item{input_genes}{A character vector of genes of interest. The \code{gprofiler2::gost()} function handles mixed types of gene IDs and even duplicates by treating them as a single unique occurrence of the identifier, disregarding any duplication.}

\item{bg_genes}{The vector of background Ensembl genes (preferably from the experiment).}

\item{bg_type}{The background type, i.e. the statistical domain, that can be one of "annotated", "known", "custom" or "custom_annotated"}

\item{sources}{A vector of data sources to use. Currently, these are set at GO:BP, KEGG and WP. Visit the g:GOSt web tool for the comprehensive list and details on incorporated data sources.}

\item{organism}{Organism ID defined for the chosen sources (e.g. if zebrafish = "drerio")}

\item{user_threshold}{Adjusted p-value cutoff for Over-Representation analysis (default at 0.05 in \code{gost()} function)}

\item{correction_method}{P-value adjustment method: one of “gSCS” ,“fdr” and “bonferroni (default set at "fdr")}

\item{exclude_iea}{Option to exclude GO electronic annotations (IEA)}

\item{only_highlighted_GO}{Whether to retain only highlighted driver GO terms in the results. Default is set to TRUE.}

\item{min_term_size}{Minimum size of gene sets to be included in the analysis. If NULL (default), no filtering by size is applied.}

\item{max_term_size}{Maximum size of gene sets to be included in the analysis. If NULL (default), no filtering by size is applied.}

\item{ngenes_enrich_filtr}{Minimum number of genes in the  input gene list needed for a gene set to be considered enriched. If NULL (default), no filtering by gene count is applied.}

\item{gmt_file_paths}{If provided, these will be uploaded to g:Profiler and included in the enrichment analysis. For guidance on creating and validating GMT files, see the g:Profiler GMT Helper: https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gmt-helper/.}

\item{path}{Destination folder for the output data results.}

\item{output_filename}{Output enrichment result filename.}

\item{overwrite}{If \code{TRUE}, the function overwrites existing output files; otherwise, it reads the existing file. (default is set to \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A named \code{list} holding two components:
-\code{unfiltered} is a named \code{list} holding two sub-components::
- \code{dr_g_a} is a dataframe of type \emph{g_a} holding the unfiltered enrichment results (e.g. all GO terms, no limits set on gene set size )
- \code{gostres} is a named list where 'result' contains the data frame with enrichment analysis results, and 'meta' contains metadata necessary for creating a Manhattan plot. This is the original output of a gprofiler2::gost(), with added enrichment ratios in the 'result' dataframe.
-\code{filtered} is named \code{list} holding two sub-components:
- \code{dr_g_a} is a dataframe of type \emph{g_a} holding the filtered enrichment results.
- \code{dr_a} is a dataframe of type \emph{a} holding the filtered enrichment results.
-\code{params} is a list of the main parameters used
}
\description{
This function utilizes gprofiler2::gost() to perform over-representation analysis on a list of genes of interest. Users can choose either standard annotation sources (e.g. GO:BP, KEGG, WP) via the \code{sources} argument, or provide one or more custom GMT files through \code{gmt_file_paths}. If both are provided, results from all sources are combined. At least one of \code{sources} or \code{gmt_file_paths} must be supplied.

Similar to the \code{clustrenrich()} workflow, the function supports filters on gene
set size (minimum and maximum), on the minimum number of input genes per
enriched set, and on whether to keep only highlighted driver GO terms.

The output contains both unfiltered and filtered results, in two formats:
"gene × annotation per row" and "annotation per row".

# 📄Content

This directory is intended for holding the raw data needed for the first steps of the project. Specifically, it should contain the raw count data, which should be downloaded here. If you are using DRomics, this data will be fed into the DRomics pipeline (`analyses/dromics-transcriptomics-data`). Any additional raw data (e.g., anchoring data) should also be stored in this directory.

## 📍Note

The suggested content and structure here follow best practices for research compendiums. However, feel free to organize and store your project files in a way that best suits your needs and workflow.

# 📄Content

This directory is intended for storing derived data generated outside of the workflow. It includes results from the DRomics pipeline (e.g. `analyses/dromics-transcriptomics-pipeline.R` and `analyses/dromics-anchoring-pipeline.R`), as well as from the standard approach pipeline (e.g. `analyses/standard-approach-pipeline.R`). Any additional results produced outside the workflow should also be stored in this directory.

## 📍Note

The suggested content and structure here follow best practices for research compendiums. However, feel free to organize and store your project files in a way that best suits your needs and workflow.

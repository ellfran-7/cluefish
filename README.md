<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Overview

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Cluefish is a free semi-automated R workflow designed for the comprehensive and untargeted exploration of dose-response transcriptomic data. Its name reflects the three key concepts driving the workflow: **Clustering**, **Enrichment**, and **Fishing**â€”metaphorically aligned with "*fishing for clues*"ðŸŽ£ in complex biological data.

When used in combination with [`DRomics`](https://lbbe-software.github.io/DRomics/) (Dose-Response for Omics), Cluefish provides a more comprehensive analysis of dose-response transcriptomic data. This workflow addresses the limitations of the standard Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) by applying ORA to pre-clustered networks. These clusters serve as anchors for ORA, enhancing enrichment detection sensitivity and thus enabling the identification of smaller, more specific biological processes while simultaneously forming exploratory gene groups.

Cluefish is designed to be adaptable to a wide range of organisms, both model and non-model, ensuring broad applicability across various biological contexts.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

You can use Cluefish locally in one of two ways:

1.  Clone the repository via a terminal:

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/ellfran-7/cluefish.git
    ```

2.  Install the developmental version of Cluefish from GitHub in R (`remotes` needed):

    ``` r
    if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
      install.packages("remotes")

    remotes::install_github("ellfran-7/cluefish")
    ```

<!-- ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS -->

## Additional Requirements

Cluefish relies on external open source software for an intermediate step within its workflow. Please ensure the following tools are installed:

1.  **Cytoscape**:
    
    Cluefish uses Cytoscape in order to visualize PPI networks. Install Cytoscape from their [official download page](https://cytoscape.org/download.html).

2.  **Required Cytoscape Apps**:
    
    Within Cytoscape, install the **StringApp** and **clusterMaker2** apps. To do this:
    -  Open Cytoscape
    -  Navigate to `Apps` > `App Store` > `Show App Store`
    -  Search for and install "StringApp" (for retrieving STRING protein interactions) and "clusterMaker2"" (for clustering network data).

You can also view more about these apps on the [Cytoscape App Store](https://apps.cytoscape.org/).


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To run the Cluefish workflow, you can use the `make.R` script, which serves as the 'master' script for the entire process. We recommend using this script as a template to ensure smooth and sequential execution of the workflow steps.

A key feature of Cluefish is the integration of `renv` to create reproducible environments. This enables you to install the required R packages in two ways:

-   Install the latest package versions with `renv::install()`.
-   For full reproducibility, install the exact package versions specified in the `renv.lock` file by running `renv::restore()`. Note that this process may take longer.

### Required inputs

Cluefish requires two key inputs:

1.  **A background transcript list**: Typically, this includes the identifiers for all detected transcripts in the experiment.
2.  **A deregulated transcript list**: A subset of the background list, containing the identifiers of significantly deregulated transcripts. This list can be derived using any selection method.

### Recommended Selection Method

While the inputs can be derived from any selection method, Cluefish was optimised to work seamlessly with the results from `DRomics`, a tool tailored for dose-response modelling of omics data.

Although using `DRomics` is optional, Cluefish leverages some of its visualization functions and modelling metrics to provide deeper insights into the biological interpretation of the data.

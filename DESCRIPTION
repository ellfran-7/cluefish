Description: A free and open-source, semi-automated R workflow designed for untargeted, comprehensive biological interpretation of transcriptomic data series. Cluefish applies over-representation analysis on pre-clustered protein-protein interaction networks, using clusters as anchors to identify smaller, more specific biological functions. Innovative features, including cluster merging and recovery of isolated genes through shared biological contexts, enable a more complete exploration of the data.

# 📄Content

This directory contains three R scripts designed to generate the main and supplementary figures and tables assembled into the Cluefish paper (Franklin et al. submitted). The files are:

-  `cluefish-figs-main-drerio.R`: Script generating the main figures of the paper.
-  `cluefish-figs-supp-drerio.R`: Script generating the supplementary figures of the paper. 
-  `cluefish-tabs-supp-drerio.R`: Script generation the supplementary tables of the paper

These pipelines are formatted to enable the direct reproduction of the results required for the Cluefish workflow and those published in Franklin et al. (submitted). However, they can also be used as adaptable templates for your own case studies.

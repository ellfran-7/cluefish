	abstract = {Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. Since the three types of evidence differ conceptually, and the number of predicted interactions is very large, it is essential to be able to assess and compare the signiﬁcance of individual predictions. Thus, STRING contains a unique scoring-framework based on benchmarks of the different types of associations against a common reference set, integrated in a single conﬁdence score per prediction. The graphical representation of the network of inferred, weighted protein interactions provides a high-level view of functional linkage, facilitating the analysis of modularity in biological processes. STRING is updated continuously, and currently contains 261 033 orthologs in 89 fully sequenced genomes. The database predicts functional interactions at an expected level of accuracy of at least 80\% for more than half of the genes; it is online at http://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/STRING/.},

	abstract = {A full description of a protein's function requires knowledge of all partner proteins with which it specifically associates. From a functional perspective, ‘association’ can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process. Currently, information about protein association is scattered over a wide variety of resources and model organisms. STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein–protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable. STRING currently holds 730 000 proteins in 180 fully sequenced organisms, and is available at http://string.embl.de/.},

            Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data. The STRING resource is available online, at https://string-db.org/.},

            Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein–protein interactions—both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.},

Although this goal is still elusive, considerable progress has been made—particularly for certain model organisms and functional systems. Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

The new version 10.0 of STRING covers more than 2000 organisms, which has necessitated novel, scalable algorithms for transferring interaction information between organisms. For this purpose, we have introduced hierarchical and selfconsistent orthology annotations for all interacting proteins, grouping the proteins into families at various levels of phylogenetic resolution. Further improvements in version 10.0 include a completely redesigned prediction pipeline for inferring protein–protein associations from co-expression data, an API interface for the R computing environment and improved statistical analysis for enrichment tests in user-provided networks.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have observed the potential association of water disinfection byproduct (DBP) exposure with cardiac defects. Aromatic DBPs represent a significant portion of total DBPs, but their effects on cardiovascular development are unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of an aromatic DBP, 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone (DCBQ), on the cardiovascular development of zebrafish embryos. After exposure to 2, 4, and 8 μM DCBQ, morphological images of growing zebrafish embryos clearly showed cardiovascular malformation. Fluorescent images of transgenic zebrafish strains with fluorescently labeled heart and blood vessels show that DCBQ exposure resulted in deformed atrium−ventricle looping, degenerated abdomen and trunk vessels, pericardial edema, and decreased blood flow. Furthermore, the expression of the marker gene myl7 (essential for the differentiation and motility of cardiomyocytes) was inhibited in a dosedependent manner by DCBQ exposure. Finally, transcriptome analysis found that in the 4 μM DCBQ exposure group, the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 113 (50 upregulated and 63 downregulated) at 24 hpf, 2123 (762 upregulated and 1361 downregulated) at 48 hpf, and 61 (11 upregulated and 50 downregulated) at 120 hpf; in the 8 μM DCBQ exposure group, the number of DEGs was 1407 (647 upregulated and 760 downregulated) at 120 hpf. The FoxO signaling pathway was significantly altered. The in vivo results demonstrate the effects of 2,6-DCBQ (0−8 μM) on cardiovascular development, contributing to the understanding of the developmental toxicity of aromatic DBP halobenzoquinones (HBQs).},

	abstract = {Background. Myopathies related to Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) mutation are the most common nondystrophy muscle disorder in humans. Early detection and diagnosis of RYR1 mutation-associated myopathies may lead to more timely treatment of patients, which contributes to the management and preparation for malignant hyperthermia. However, diagnosis of RYR1 mutation-associated myopathies is delayed and challenging. The absence of diagnostic morphological features in muscle biopsy does not rule out the possibility of pathogenic variations in RYR1. Accordingly, it is helpful to seek biomarkers to diagnose RYR1 mutation-associated myopathies. Methods. Skeletal muscle tissue microarray datasets of RYR1 mutation-associated myopathies or healthy persons were built in accordance with the gene expression synthesis (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified on the basis of R software. Genes specific to tissue/organ were identified through BioGPS. An enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted in accordance with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). We also built protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to explore the function and enrichment pathway of DEGs and the identification of hub genes. Lastly, the ROC curve was drawn for hub genes achieving specific expressions within skeletal muscle. Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) was obtained to calculate the predictive value of key genes. The transcription factors of hub genes achieving specific expressions within skeletal muscle were predicted with the use of the iRegulon plugin. Results. We identified 170 DEGs among 11 muscle biopsy samples of healthy subjects and 17 muscle biopsy samples of RYR1 mutation-associated myopathy patients in the dataset. Among the above DEGs, 30 genes achieving specific expressions within tissues/organs were found. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs mainly focused on muscle contraction, actin-mediated cell contraction, actin filament-based movement, and muscular sliding. 12 hub genes were identified with the use of Cytoscape. Four hub genes were specifically expressed in skeletal muscle tissue, including MYH1 (AUC: 0.856), TNNT3 (AUC: 0.840), MYLPF (AUC: 0.786), and ATP2A1 (AUC: 0.765). The iRegulon predicted results suggested that the transcription factor MYF6 was found with the highest reliability. Conclusions. Four skeletal muscle tissue-specific genes were identified, including MYH1, TNNT3, MYLPF, and ATP2A1, as the potential biomarkers for diagnosing and treating RYR1 mutation-associated myopathies, which provided insights into the transcriptome-level development mechanism. The transcription factor MYF6 may be a vital upstream regulator of the above biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays numerous critical roles in maintaining vision and this is underscored by the prevalence of degenerative blinding diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which visual impairment is caused by progressive loss of RPE cells. In contrast to mammals, zebrafish possess the ability to intrinsically regenerate a functional RPE layer after severe injury. The molecular underpinnings of this regenerative process remain largely unknown yet hold tremendous potential for developing treatment strategies to stimulate endogenous regeneration in the human eye. In this study, we demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is activated in RPE cells post-genetic ablation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of mTOR activity impaired RPE regeneration, while mTOR activation enhanced RPE recovery post-injury, demonstrating that mTOR activity is necessary and sufficient for RPE regeneration in zebrafish. RNA-seq of RPE isolated from mTOR-inhibited larvae identified a number of genes and pathways dependent on mTOR activity at early and late stages of regeneration; amongst these were components of the immune system, which is emerging as a key regulator of regenerative responses across various tissue and model systems. Our results identify crosstalk between macrophages/microglia and the RPE, wherein mTOR activity in the RPE is required for recruitment of macrophages/microglia to the injury site. In turn, these macrophages/microglia reinforce mTOR activity in regenerating RPE cells. Interestingly, the function of macrophages/microglia in maintaining mTOR activity in the RPE appeared to be inflammation-independent. Taken together, these data identify mTOR activity as a key regulator of RPE regeneration and link the mTOR pathway to immune responses in facilitating RPE regeneration.
AUTHOR SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness world-wide, with incidences predicted to rise substantially over the next few decades. Cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are affected in AMD and there are currently no effective therapies that slow RPE cell death or restore lost RPE cells in advanced-stage AMD. An exciting potential approach to treat many diseases of the eye, including AMD, is to stimulate endogenous regeneration to restore cells lost to disease. For this to become possible, we must first understand the molecular and cellular underpinnings of the regenerative response. In this study, we utilize zebrafish as a model system, which possess tremendous regenerative potential in multiple cell and tissue types, including the RPE. Our results identify the mTOR signaling pathway as a key regulator of RPE regeneration. We identify a link between mTOR signaling and immune responses, which are known to modulate regeneration of a variety of tissues and organs. Together, our results identify one of the first molecular mechanisms facilitating intrinsic RPE regeneration and these data could serve as a foundation for the development of new therapies aimed at stimulating the regeneration of RPE cells in the diseased eye.},

A total of 360,971,498 clean reads were obtained from samples, 382 DEGs in the brain and 926 DEGs in the spleen were identified. These DEGs were annotated into three ontologies after gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these DEGs were primarily related to Influenza. A pathway and Herpes simplex infection pathway in brain and Tuberculosis and Toxoplasmosis pathways in spleen, and all of these pathways may be involved in response to pathogen invasion. The transcriptome analysis results demonstrated changes and tissue-specific influences caused by SVCV in vivo, which provided us with more information to understand the complex relationships between SVCV and its host.},

	abstract = {As one of the critical abiotic factors, temperature controls fish development and reproduction. However, the effects of low temperature on the transcriptional regulation of zebrafish reproduction remain largely unclear. In this study, the fecundity of zebrafish was examined after exposure to cold temperatures at 19.5 °C, 19 °C, 18.5 °C, or 18 °C. The temperature at 19 °C showed no significant influence on the fecundity of zebrafish, but temperature at 18.5 °C or 18 °C significantly blocked the spawning of females, suggesting the existence of a low temperature critical point for the spawning of zebrafish females. Based on these observations, the brains of anesthetized fish under cold stress at different cold temperatures were collected for high-throughput RNA-seq assays. Key genes, hub pathways and important biological processes responding to cold temperatures during the spawning of zebrafish were identified through bioinformatic analysis. The number of down-regulated and up-regulated genes during the temperature reduction from egg-spawning temperatures at 19.5 °C and 19 °C to non-spawning temperatures at 18.5 °C and 18 °C were 2588 and 2527 (fold change ≥ 1.5 and p-value ≤ 0.01), respectively. Venn analysis was performed to identify up- and down-regulated key genes. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the hub pathways overrepresented among down-regulated key genes included the GnRH signaling pathway, vascular smooth muscle contraction, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol signaling system and insulin signaling pathway. GO enrichment analysis of down-regulated key genes revealed the most important biological processes inhibited under non-spawning temperatures at 18.5 °C and 18 °C were photoreceptor cell outer segment organization, circadian regulation of gene expression and photoreceptor cell maintenance. Furthermore, 99 hormone-related genes were found in the brain tissues of non-spawning and spawning groups, and GnRH signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway were enriched from down-regulated genes related to hormones at 18.5 °C and 18 °C. Thus, these findings uncovered crucial hormone-related genes and signaling pathways controlling the spawning of female zebrafish under cold stress.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a degenerative disease that endangers human health. At present, chemical drugs used for osteoporosis have serious side effects. Therefore, it is valuable to search herbs with high safety and good curative effect in antiosteoporosis. Erzhi formula (EZF), an ancient classic compound, has been reported to have a beneficial effect in antiosteoporosis, but its mechanism is unclear. In this paper, the active compounds of EZF were found in Systems Pharmacology Database, and gene targets related to osteoporosis were obtained in GeneCards. The GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by Metascape. The network of “components-targets-signal pathway” was constructed by Cytoscape. Next, molecular docking between the active components and hub genes related to the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was conducted by Autodock. In the verification experiment, the zebrafish induced by prednisolone (PNSL) was used to reproduce glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) model, and then the reversal effects of EZF were systematically evaluated according to the behavior, skull staining area, bone mineralization area (BMA), average optical density (AOD), and cumulative optical density (COD). Finally, it was shown that 24 components in EZF could regulate 39 common gene targets to exert antiosteoporosis effect. Besides, the main regulatory mechanisms of EZF were 4 signaling pathways: PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, AGE-RAGE, and cancer pathway. In PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, wedelolactone, dimethyl wedelolactone, specnuezhenide, ursolic acid, acacetin, beta-sitosterol, apigenin, and kaempferol can bind tightly with EGF, IL-2, and IL-4 genes. Compared with the model group, the moving distance, swimming speed, and cumulative swimming time of zebrafish in EZF group were significantly increased (

              ). Meanwhile, the BMA and COD of zebrafish were significantly improved after the intervention of EZF (
              
                
                  P

              ). In summary, the 24 components of EZF exert their antiosteoporosis effects by regulating 39 related gene targets, among which the PI3K signaling pathway is crucial. EZF can promote bone formation and reversed GIOP through “multicomponent/multitarget/multipathway” and the medium dose of EZF may be the most suitable concentration for the treatment of GIOP in zebrafish model.},

The outcome is intended to support the identification of substances with endocrine disruptor mode of action. For this specific purpose, an evidence-based approach methodology was adopted. Available evidence was systematically mapped from the literature to identify Molecular Initiating Events (MIEs) and Key Events (KEs) linked to adverse outcome (AO) “uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma” independently from prototypical stressors, by means of: 1. a priori defined search strategies initially addressing the AO and biologically plausible MIEs, 2. application of machine learning technique (Topic modelling) that automatically analyzes text data to identify biologically plausible KERs, 3. systematic literature review and critical appraisal of prioritized evidence, taking into account human, in vivo and in vitro studies. Estradiol and tamoxifen, two recognized human risk factors for endometrioid adenocarcinoma, were used as tool chemical compounds to empirically support the response and temporal concordance of the identified key event relationships (KERs). All evidence has been then integrated by means of the AOP conceptual network. An evidence-based AOP starting from activation of uterine estrogen receptor-alfa leading to endometrial adenocarcinoma via epigenetic modulation was postulated.},

	abstract = {Clinical islet transplantation has recently been a promising treatment option for intractable type 1 diabetes patients. Although early graft loss has been well studied and controlled, the mechanisms of late graft loss largely remains obscure. Since long-term islet graft survival had not been achieved in islet xenotransplantation, it has been impossible to explore the mechanism of late islet graft loss. Fortunately, recent advances where consistent long-term survival (≥6 months) of adult porcine islet grafts was achieved in five independent, diabetic nonhuman primates (NHPs) enabled us to investigate on the late graft loss. Regardless of the conventional immune monitoring methods applied in the post-transplant period, the initiation of late graft loss could rarely be detected before the overt graft loss observed via uncontrolled blood glucose level. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed the gene expression profiles in 2 rhesus monkey recipients using peripheral blood RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to find out the potential cause(s) of late graft loss. Bioinformatic analyses showed that highly relevant immunological pathways were activated in the animal which experienced late graft failure. Further connectivity analyses revealed that the activation of T cell signaling pathways was the most prominent, suggesting that T cell-mediated graft rejection could be the cause of the late-phase islet loss. Indeed, the porcine islets in the biopsied monkey liver samples were heavily infiltrated with CD3+ T cells. Furthermore, hypothesis test using a computational experiment reinforced our conclusion. Taken together, we suggest that bioinformatics analyses with peripheral blood RNA-seq could unveil the cause of insidious late islet graft loss.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe.Results: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods.Availability: SPIA was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/Contact:  sorin@wayne.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring molecule present in plants from Brassica family. It becomes bioactive after hydrolytic reaction mediated by myrosinase or human gastrointestinal microbiota. Sulforaphane gained scientific popularity due to its antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. However, its toxicity profile and potential to cause adverse effects remain largely unidentified. Thus, this study aimed to generate SFN-triggered adverse outcome pathway (AOP) by looking at the relationship between SFN-chemical structure and its toxicity, as well as SFN-gene interactions. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis identified 2 toxophores (Derek Nexus software) that have the potential to cause chromosomal damage and skin sensitization in mammals or mutagenicity in bacteria. Data extracted from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) linked SFN with previously proposed outcomes via gene interactions. The total of 11 and 146 genes connected SFN with chromosomal damage and skin diseases, respectively. However, network analysis (NetworkAnalyst tool) revealed that these genes function in wider networks containing 490 and 1986 nodes, respectively. The over-representation analysis (ExpressAnalyst tool) pointed out crucial biological pathways regulated by SFN-interfering genes. These pathways are uploaded to AOP-helpFinder tool which found the 2321 connections between 19 enriched pathways and SFN which were further considered as key events. Two major, interconnected AOPs were generated: first starting from disruption of biological pathways involved in cell cycle and cell proliferation leading to increased apoptosis, and the second one connecting activated immune system signaling pathways to inflammation and apoptosis. In both cases, chromosomal damage and/or skin diseases such as dermatitis or psoriasis appear as adverse outcomes.},

Although toxicogenomics supports mechanistic evaluation of chemical exposures, its implementation into the regulatory framework is hindered by uncertainties in the analysis and interpretation of such data. The use of mechanistic evidence through the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept is promoted for the development of new approach methodologies (NAMs) that can reduce animal experimentation. However, to unleash the full potential of AOPs and build confidence into toxicogenomics, robust associations between AOPs and patterns of molecular alteration need to be established. Systematic curation of molecular events to AOPs will create the much-needed link between toxicogenomics and systemic mechanisms depicted by the AOPs. This, in turn, will introduce novel ways of benefitting from the AOPs, including predictive models and targeted assays, while also reducing the need for multiple testing strategies. Hence, a multi-step strategy to annotate AOPs is developed, and the resulting associations are applied to successfully highlight relevant adverse outcomes for chemical exposures with strong in vitro and in vivo convergence, supporting chemical grouping and other data-driven approaches. Finally, a panel of AOP-derived in vitro biomarkers for pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is identified and experimentally validated.},

	abstract = {Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a computational biology method that identifies biological functions that are overrepresented in a group of genes more than would be expected by chance and ranks these functions by relevance. The relative abundance of genes pertinent to specific pathways is measured through statistical methods, and associated functional pathways are retrieved from online bioinformatics databases. In the last decade, along with the spread of the internet, higher availability of computational resources made PEA software tools easy to access and to use for bioinformatics practitioners worldwide. Although it became easier to use these tools, it also became easier to make mistakes that could generate inflated or misleading results, especially for beginners and inexperienced computational biologists. With this article, we propose nine quick tips to avoid common mistakes and to out a complete, sound, thorough PEA, which can produce relevant and robust results. We describe our nine guidelines in a simple way, so that they can be understood and used by anyone, including students and beginners. Some tips explain what to do before starting a PEA, others are suggestions of how to correctly generate meaningful results, and some final guidelines indicate some useful steps to properly interpret PEA results. Our nine tips can help users perform better pathway enrichment analyses and eventually contribute to a better understanding of current biology.},

First, we performed pathway enrichment analyses of regulated genes to reveal active pathways among 163 biological pathways. Next, we explored potential target proteins (including primary targets and off-targets) with cell-specific transcriptional similarity using chemical–protein interactome. Finally, we predicted new therapeutic indications for 461 diseases based on the target proteins. We showed the usefulness of the proposed approach in terms of prediction coverage, interpretation, and large-scale applicability, and validated the new prediction results experimentally by an in vitro cellular assay. The approach has a high potential for advancing drug discovery and repositioning.},

	abstract = {Pathway enrichment analysis has become a widely used knowledge-based approach for the interpretation of biomedical data. Its popularity has led to an explosion of both enrichment methods and pathway databases. While the elegance of pathway enrichment lies in its simplicity, multiple factors can impact the results of such an analysis, which may not be accounted for. Researchers may fail to give influential aspects their due, resorting instead to popular methods and gene set collections, or default settings. Despite ongoing efforts to establish set guidelines, meaningful results are still hampered by a lack of consensus or gold standards around how enrichment analysis should be conducted. Nonetheless, such concerns have prompted a series of benchmark studies specifically focused on evaluating the influence of various factors on pathway enrichment results. In this review, we organize and summarize the findings of these benchmarks to provide a comprehensive overview on the influence of these factors. Our work covers a broad spectrum of factors, spanning from methodological assumptions to those related to prior biological knowledge, such as pathway definitions and database choice. In doing so, we aim to shed light on how these aspects can lead to insignificant, uninteresting or even contradictory results. Finally, we conclude the review by proposing future benchmarks as well as solutions to overcome some of the challenges, which originate from the outlined factors.},

Several computational methods combine untargeted omics data with prior knowledge to estimate the state of signaling networks in specific biological scenarios. Here, we review, compare, and classify recent network approaches according to their characteristics in terms of input omics data, prior knowledge and underlying methodologies. We highlight existing challenges in the field, such as the general lack of ground truth and the limitations of prior knowledge. We also point out new omics developments that may have a profound impact, such as single-cell proteomics or large-scale profiling of protein conformational changes. We provide both an introduction for interested users seeking strategies to study cell signaling on a large scale and an update for seasoned modelers.},

Here, we address this gap by introducing the TFLink gateway, which uniquely provides experimentally explored and highly accurate information on transcription factor–target gene interactions (∼12 million), nucleotide sequences and genomic locations of transcription factor binding sites (∼9 million) for human and six model organisms: mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm and yeast by integrating 10 resources. TFLink provides user-friendly access to data on transcription factor–target gene interactions, interactive network visualizations and transcription factor binding sites, with cross-links to several other databases. Besides containing accurate information on transcription factors, with a clear labelling of the type/volume of the experiments (small-scale or high-throughput), the source database and the original publications, TFLink also provides a wealth of standardized regulatory data available for download in multiple formats. The database offers easy access to high-quality data for wet-lab researchers, supplies data for gene set enrichment analyses and facilitates systems biology and comparative gene regulation studies.Database URLhttps://tflink.net/},

	abstract = {Sewage effluent ozonation can reduce concentrations of chemical pollutants including pharmaceutical residues. However, the formation of potentially toxic ozonation byproducts (OBPs) is a matter of concern. This study sought to elucidate toxicity mechanisms of ozonated carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug frequently detected in sewage effluents and surface water, in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Embryos were exposed to ozonated and non-ozonated CBZ from 3 h post-fertilization (hpf) until 144 hpf. Embryotoxicity endpoints (proportion of dead and malformed embryos) were assessed at 24, 48, and 144 hpf. Heart rate was recorded at 48 hpf. Exposure to ozonated CBZ gave rise to cardiovascular-related malformations and reduced heart rate. Moreover, embryo-larvae exposed to ozonated CBZ displayed a lack of swim bladder inflation. Hence, the expression patterns of CBZ target genes involved in cardiovascular and embryonal development were investigated through a stepwise gene co-expression analysis approach. Two co-expression networks and their upstream transcription regulators were identified, offering mechanistic explanations for the observed toxicity phenotypes. The study presents a novel application of gene co-expression analysis elucidating potential toxicity mechanisms of an ozonated pharmaceutical with environmental relevance. The resulting data was used to establish a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP).},

	abstract = {Several available online tools provide network growing functions where an algorithm utilizing different data sources suggests additional genes/proteins that should connect an input gene set into functionally meaningful networks. Using the well-studied system of influenza host interactions, we compare the network growing function of two free tools GeneMANIA and STRING and the commercial IPA for their performance of recovering known influenza A virus host factors previously identified from siRNA screens. The result showed that given small ({\textasciitilde}30 genes) or medium ({\textasciitilde}150 genes) input sets all three network growing tools detect significantly more known host factors than random human genes with STRING overall performing strongest. Extending the networks with all the three tools significantly improved the detection of GO biological processes of known host factors compared to not growing networks. Interestingly, the rate of identification of true host factors using computational network growing is equal or better to doing another experimental siRNA screening study which could also be true and applied to other biological pathways/processes.},

The system provides biologists with a framework to analyze their candidate gene sets in the context of functional networks, expanding or refining their sets using functional relationships predicted from integrated high-throughput data. IMP 2.0 integrates updated prior knowledge and data collections from the last three years in the seven supported organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and extends function prediction coverage to include human disease. IMP identifies homologs with conserved functional roles for disease knowledge transfer, allowing biologists to analyze disease contexts and predictions across all organisms. Additionally, IMP 2.0 implements a new flexible platform for experts to generate custom hypotheses about biological processes or diseases, making sophisticated data-driven methods easily accessible to researchers. IMP does not require any registration or installation and is freely available for use at http://imp.princeton.edu.},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is gaining popularity as a complementary assay to genome sequencing for precisely identifying the molecular causes of rare disorders. A powerful approach is to identify aberrant gene expression levels as potential pathogenic events. However, existing methods for detecting aberrant read counts in RNA-seq data either lack assessments of statistical significance, so that establishing cutoffs is arbitrary, or rely on subjective manual corrections for confounders. Here, we describe OUTRIDER (Outlier in RNA-Seq Finder), an algorithm developed to address these issues. The algorithm uses an autoencoder to model read-count expectations according to the gene covariation resulting from technical, environmental, or common genetic variations. Given these expectations, the RNA-seq read counts are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with a gene-specific dispersion. Outliers are then identified as read counts that significantly deviate from this distribution. The model is automatically fitted to achieve the best recall of artificially corrupted data. Precision-recall analyses using simulated outlier read counts demonstrated the importance of controlling for covariation and significance-based thresholds. OUTRIDER is open source and includes functions for filtering out genes not expressed in a dataset, for identifying outlier samples with too many aberrantly expressed genes, and for detecting aberrant gene expression on the basis of false-discovery-rate-adjusted p values. Overall, OUTRIDER provides an end-to-end solution for identifying aberrantly expressed genes and is suitable for use by rare-disease diagnostic platforms.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

This dual nature, acting as both a knowledgebase and a discoverybase, makes CTD a unique resource for the scientific community.

We also present CTD Tetramers, a novel tool that computationally generates four-unit information blocks connecting a chemical, gene, phenotype, and disease to construct potential molecular mechanistic pathways. Finally, we integrate terms for human biological media used in the CTD Exposure module to corresponding CTD Anatomy pages, allowing users to survey the chemical profiles for any tissue-of-interest and see how these environmental biomarkers are related to phenotypes for any anatomical site. These, and other webpage visual enhancements, continue to promote CTD as a practical, user-friendly, and innovative resource for finding information and generating testable hypotheses about environmental health.},

	abstract = {Annotating the functional properties of gene products, i.e., RNAs and proteins, is a fundamental task in biology. The Gene Ontology database (GO) was developed to systematically describe the functional properties of gene products across species, and to facilitate the computational prediction of gene function. As GO is routinely updated, it serves as the gold standard and main knowledge source in functional genomics. Many gene function prediction methods making use of GO have been proposed. But no literature review has summarized these methods and the possibilities for future efforts from the perspective of GO. To bridge this gap, we review the existing methods with an emphasis on recent solutions. First, we introduce the conventions of GO and the widely adopted evaluation metrics for gene function prediction. Next, we summarize current methods of gene function prediction that apply GO in different ways, such as using hierarchical or flat inter-relationships between GO terms, compressing massive GO terms and quantifying semantic similarities. Although many efforts have improved performance by harnessing GO, we conclude that there remain many largely overlooked but important topics for future research.},

	abstract = {The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an established model organism for developmental and biomedical research. It is frequently used for high-throughput functional genomics experiments, such as genome-wide gene expression measurements, to systematically analyze molecular mechanisms. However, the use of whole embryos or larvae in such experiments leads to a loss of the spatial information. To address this problem, we have developed a tool called Zebrafish Expression Ontology of Gene Sets (ZEOGS) to assess the enrichment of anatomical terms in large gene sets. ZEOGS uses gene expression pattern data from several sources: first, in situ hybridization experiments from the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN); second, it uses the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology, a controlled vocabulary that describes connected anatomical structures; and third, the available connections between expression patterns and anatomical terms contained in ZFIN. Upon input of a gene set, ZEOGS determines which anatomical structures are overrepresented in the input gene set. ZEOGS allows one for the first time to look at groups of genes and to describe them in terms of shared anatomical structures. To establish ZEOGS, we first tested it on random gene selections and on two public microarray datasets with known tissue-specific gene expression changes. These tests showed that ZEOGS could reliably identify the tissues affected, whereas only very few enriched terms to none were found in the random gene sets. Next we applied ZEOGS to microarray datasets of 24 and 72 h postfertilization zebrafish embryos treated with beclomethasone, a potent glucocorticoid. This analysis resulted in the identification of several anatomical terms related to glucocorticoid-responsive tissues, some of which were stage-specific. Our studies highlight the ability of ZEOGS to extract spatial information from datasets derived from whole embryos, indicating that ZEOGS could be a useful tool to automatically analyze gene expression pattern features of any large zebrafish gene set.},

Since the number of possible combinations of intercellular and extracellular conditions is almost unlimited, cataloging all transcriptome conditions would be an immeasurable challenge. Gene coexpression refers to the similarity of gene expression patterns under various conditions, such as disease states, tissue types, and developmental stages. Since the quality of gene coexpression data depends on the quality and quantity of transcriptome data, timely usage of the growing data is key to promoting individual research in molecular biology. COXPRESdb (http://coxpresdb.jp) is a database providing coexpression information for 11 animal species. One characteristic feature of COXPRESdb is its ability to compare multiple coexpression data derived from different transcriptomics technologies and different species, which strongly reduces false positive relationships in individual gene coexpression data. Here, we summarized the current version of this database, including 23 coexpression platforms with the highest-level quality till date. Using various functionalities in COXPRESdb, the new coexpression data would support a broader area of research from molecular biology to medical sciences.},

While in the beginning pathway analysis relied on enrichment-based approaches, a newer generation of methods is now available, exploiting pathway topologies in addition to gene/protein expression levels. However, little effort has been invested in their critical assessment with respect to their performance in different experimental setups. Here, we assessed the performance of seven representative methods identifying differentially expressed pathways between two groups of interest based on gene expression data with prior knowledge of pathway topologies: SPIA, PRS, CePa, TAPPA, TopologyGSA, Clipper and DEGraph. We performed a number of controlled experiments that investigated their sensitivity to sample and pathway size, threshold-based filtering of differentially expressed genes, ability to detect target pathways, ability to exploit the topological information and the sensitivity to different pre-processing strategies. We also verified type I error rates and described the influence of overexpression of single genes, gene sets and topological motifs of various sizes on the detection of a pathway as differentially expressed. The results of our experiments demonstrate a wide variability of the tested methods. We provide a set of recommendations for an informed selection of the proper method for a given data analysis task.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Experiments such as ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq, ChIP-PET and DamID (the four methods referred herein as ChIP-X) are used to profile the binding of transcription factors to DNA at a genome-wide scale. Such experiments provide hundreds to thousands of potential binding sites for a given transcription factor in proximity to gene coding regions.Results: In order to integrate data from such studies and utilize it for further biological discovery, we collected interactions from such experiments to construct a mammalian ChIP-X database. The database contains 189 933 interactions, manually extracted from 87 publications, describing the binding of 92 transcription factors to 31 932 target genes. We used the database to analyze mRNA expression data where we perform gene-list enrichment analysis using the ChIP-X database as the prior biological knowledge gene-list library. The system is delivered as a web-based interactive application called ChIP Enrichment Analysis (ChEA). With ChEA, users can input lists of mammalian gene symbols for which the program computes over-representation of transcription factor targets from the ChIP-X database. The ChEA database allowed us to reconstruct an initial network of transcription factors connected based on shared overlapping targets and binding site proximity. To demonstrate the utility of ChEA we present three case studies. We show how by combining the Connectivity Map (CMAP) with ChEA, we can rank pairs of compounds to be used to target specific transcription factor activity in cancer cells.Availability: The ChEA software and ChIP-X database is freely available online at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/lib/chea.jspContact:  avi.maayan@mssm.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from OrthoDB, BUSCO can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the BUSCO tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various BUSCO running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the BUSCO setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and BUSCO “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using BUSCO results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Network propagation refers to a class of algorithms that integrate information from input data across connected nodes in a given network. These algorithms have wide applications in systems biology, protein function prediction, inferring condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation, there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms on real data and little guidance on how to select and parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this problem by analyzing different combinations of network normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on real proteome and transcriptome data. Our work highlights the risk of a ‘topology bias’ caused by the incorrect use of network normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g. proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the utility and robustness of network propagation on multi-omics datasets for identifying ageing-associated genes in brain and liver tissues of rats and for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression. Overall, this work compares different network propagation approaches and it presents strategies for how to use network propagation algorithms to optimally address a specific research question at hand.},

	abstract = {Existing software tools for topology-based pathway enrichment analysis are either computationally inefficient, have undesirable statistical power, or require expert knowledge to leverage the methods’ capabilities. To address these limitations, we have overhauled NetGSA, an existing topology-based method, to provide a computationally-efficient user-friendly tool that offers interactive visualization. Pathway enrichment analysis for thousands of genes can be performed in minutes on a personal computer without sacrificing statistical power. The new software also removes the need for expert knowledge by directly curating gene-gene interaction information from multiple external databases. Lastly, by utilizing the capabilities of Cytoscape, the new software also offers interactive and intuitive network visualization., With the increase in publicly available pathway topology information, topology-based pathway enrichment methods have become effective tools to analyze omics data. While many different methods are available, none are uniformly best. This paper focused on overhauling an existing topology-based method, NetGSA. The three key improvements included dramatically reduced computation time so pathway enrichment can be performed within minutes on a personal computer, integration of publicly available pathway topology databases so users can easily leverage the entire capabilities of the NetGSA method, and facilitating interactive visualization of results through an interface with Cytoscape, a popular network visualization tool. The improved NetGSA was compared to the previous version as well as other similar pathway topology-based methods and achieves competitive statistical power. With these improvements and NetGSA’s flexibility to address a diverse set of problems and data types, we believe that the new NetGSA can be a useful tool for practitioners. The updated NetGSA is available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netgsa/index.html and the development version is available on GitHub at https://github.com/mikehellstern/netgsa.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic mRNA decay is initiated by shortening of the poly (A) tail; however, neither the molecular mechanisms underlying deadenylation nor its regulation is well understood. The human CCR4–NOT complex is a major cytoplasmic deadenylase consisting of a combination of at least nine subunits, four of which have deadenylase activity. The roles of the other subunits remain obscure. Here, we show that CNOT2 depletion by siRNA induces apoptosis. We also show that CNOT2 depletion destabilizes the complex, resulting in the formation of a complex smaller than that formed in control siRNA-treated cells. The deadenylase activity of the CNOT6L subunit-containing complex prepared from CNOT2-depleted cells was less than that from control cells. Intriguingly, the formation of P-bodies, where mRNA degradation supposedly takes place, was largely suppressed in CNOT2-depleted cells. Furthermore, CNOT2 depletion enhanced CHOP mRNA levels, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was occurring, which causes apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. These results suggest that CNOT2 is important for controlling cell viability through the maintenance of the structural integrity and enzymatic activity of the CCR4–NOT complex.},

	abstract = {Background: The Ccr4-Not complex is a key eukaryotic regulator of gene transcription and cytoplasmic mRNA degradation. Whether this complex also affects aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation, such as mRNA export, remains largely unexplored. Human Caf1 (hCaf1), a Ccr4-Not complex member, interacts with and regulates the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, whose targets include RNA binding proteins involved in mRNA export. However, the functional significance of this regulation is poorly understood.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate using co-immunoprecipitation approaches that Ccr4-Not subunits interact with Hmt1, the budding yeast ortholog of PRMT1. Furthermore, using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that Ccr4-Not physically and functionally interacts with the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) Nab2 and Hrp1, and that the physical association depends on Hmt1 methyltransferase activity. Using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and genetic approaches, we also uncover physical and functional interactions between Ccr4-Not subunits and components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and we provide evidence that these interactions impact mRNA export.
Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our findings suggest that Ccr4-Not has previously unrealized functional connections to the mRNA processing/export pathway that are likely important for its role in gene expression. These results shed further insight into the biological functions of Ccr4-Not and suggest that this complex is involved in all aspects of mRNA biogenesis, from the regulation of transcription to mRNA export and turnover.},

Understanding these systems requires integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyse experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene to transcript to protein mappings.

	abstract = {Summary:  biomaRt is a new Bioconductor package that integrates BioMart data resources with data analysis software in Bioconductor. It can annotate a wide range of gene or gene product identifiers (e.g. Entrez-Gene and Affymetrix probe identifiers) with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and OMIM annotation. Furthermore biomaRt enables retrieval of genomic sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct SQL queries to the BioMart databases (e.g. Ensembl). The biomaRt package provides a tight integration of large, public or locally installed BioMart databases with data analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data mining.Availability:  http://www.bioconductor.org.

	abstract = {Omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, metabolomics) are promising for ecological risk assessment (ERA) since they provide mechanistic information and early warning signals. A crucial step in the analysis of omics data is the modeling of concentration-dependency which may have different trends including monotonic (e.g., linear, exponential) or biphasic (e.g., U shape, bell shape) forms. The diversity of responses raises challenges concerning detection and modeling of significant responses and effect concentration (EC) derivation. Furthermore, handling high-throughput data sets is time-consuming and requires effective and automated processing routines. Thus, we developed an open source tool (DRomics, available as an R-package and as a web-based service) which, after elimination of molecular responses (e.g., gene expressions from microarrays) with no concentration-dependency and/or high variability, identifies the best model for concentration–response curve description. Subsequently, an EC (e.g., a benchmark dose) is estimated from each curve, and curves are classified based on their model parameters. This tool is especially dedicated to manage data obtained from an experimental design favoring a great number of tested doses rather than a great number of replicates and also to handle properly monotonic and biphasic trends. The tool finally provides restitution for a table of results that can be directly used to perform ERA approaches.},

Increasingly more content creators, initiatives, projects and tools have started using WikiPathways. Central in this growth and increased use of WikiPathways are the various communities that focus on particular subsets of molecular pathways such as for rare diseases and lipid metabolism. Knowledge from published pathway figures helps prioritize pathway development, using optical character and named entity recognition. We show the growth of WikiPathways over the last three years, highlight the new communities and collaborations of pathway authors and curators, and describe various technologies to connect to external resources and initiatives. The road toward a sustainable, community-driven pathway database goes through integration with other resources such as Wikidata and allowing more use, curation and redistribution of WikiPathways content.},

Concepts of “mode of action” and “mechanism of action” are used in particular ways within the regulatory arena, depending on the specific assessment goals. The data requirements for delineating a mode of action and predicting interactive toxicity in mixtures are not well defined from a scientific standpoint due largely to inherent difficulties in testing certain underlying assumptions. Understanding the regulatory perspective on mechanistic concepts will be important for designing experiments that can be interpreted clearly and applied in risk assessments without undue reliance on extrapolation and assumption. In like fashion, regulators and risk assessors can be better equipped to apply mechanistic data if the concepts underlying mechanistic research and the limitations that must be placed on interpretation of mechanistic data are understood. This will be critically important for applying new technologies to risk assessment, such as functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. It will be essential not only for risk assessors to become conversant with the language and concepts of mechanistic research, including new omic technologies, but also, for researchers to become more intimately familiar with the challenges and needs of risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Cantharidin (CTD), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine mylabris, has shown significant curative effects against a variety of tumors, but its clinical application is limited by its high toxicity. Studies have revealed that CTD can cause toxicity in the kidneys; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects in mouse kidneys following CTD treatment by pathological and ultrastructure observations, biochemical index detection, and transcriptomics, and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The results showed that after CTD exposure, the kidneys had different degrees of pathological damage, altered uric acid and creatinine levels in serum, and the antioxidant indexes in tissues were significantly increased. These changes were more pronounced at medium and high doses of CTD. RNA-seq analysis revealed 674 differentially expressed genes compared with the control group, of which 131 were upregulated and 543 were downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses showed that many differentially expressed genes were closely related to the stress response, the CIDE protein family, and the transporter superfamily, as well as the MAPK, AMPK, and HIF-1 pathways. The reliability of the RNA-seq results was verified by qRT-PCR of the six target genes. These findings offer insight into the molecular mechanisms of renal toxicity caused by CTD and provide an important theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of CTD-induced nephrotoxicity.},

To ascertain the frequency of these issues in the literature, we performed a screen of 186 open-access research articles describing functional enrichment results. We find that 95\% of analyses using over-representation tests did not implement an appropriate background gene list or did not describe this in the methods. Failure to perform p-value correction for multiple tests was identified in 43\% of analyses. Many studies lacked detail in the methods section about the tools and gene sets used. An extension of this survey showed that these problems are not associated with journal or article level bibliometrics. Using seven independent RNA-seq datasets, we show misuse of enrichment tools alters results substantially. In conclusion, most published functional enrichment studies suffered from one or more major flaws, highlighting the need for stronger standards for enrichment analysis.},

	abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION
Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are believed to be important sources of information related to biological processes and complex metabolic functions of the cell. The presence of biologically relevant functional modules in these networks has been theorized by many researchers. However, the application of traditional clustering algorithms for extracting these modules has not been successful, largely due to the presence of noisy false positive interactions as well as specific topological challenges in the network.


RESULTS
In this article, we propose an ensemble clustering framework to address this problem. For base clustering, we introduce two topology-based distance metrics to counteract the effects of noise. We develop a PCA-based consensus clustering technique, designed to reduce the dimensionality of the consensus problem and yield informative clusters. We also develop a soft consensus clustering variant to assign multifaceted proteins to multiple functional groups. We conduct an empirical evaluation of different consensus techniques using topology-based, information theoretic and domain-specific validation metrics and show that our approaches can provide significant benefits over other state-of-the-art approaches. Our analysis of the consensus clusters obtained demonstrates that ensemble clustering can (a) produce improved biologically significant functional groupings; and (b) facilitate soft clustering by discovering multiple functional associations for proteins.

	abstract = {In 2007, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released a report, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy, that envisions a not-so-distant future in which virtually all routine toxicity testing would be conducted in human cells or cell lines in vitro by evaluating cellular responses in a suite of toxicity pathway assays using high-throughput tests, that could be implemented with robotic assistance. Risk assessment based on results of these types of tests would shift towards the avoidance of significant perturbations of these pathways in exposed human populations. Dose-response modeling of perturbations of pathway function would be organized around computational systems biology models of the circuitry underlying each toxicity pathway. In vitro to in vivo extrapolations would rely on pharmacokinetic models to predict human blood and tissue concentrations under specific exposure conditions. All of the scientific tools needed to affect these changes in toxicity testing practices are either currently available or in an advanced state of development. A broad scientific discussion of this new vision for the future of toxicity testing is needed to motivate a departure from the traditional high dose animal-based toxicological tests, with its attendant challenges for dose and species extrapolation, towards a new approach more firmly grounded in human biology. The present paper, and invited commentaries on the report that will appear in Toxicological Sciences over the next year, are intended to initiate a dialog to identify challenges in implementing the vision and address obstacles to change.},

However, MOA classification has never been standardized in ecotoxicology, and a comprehensive comparison of classification tools and approaches has never been reported. Here we critically evaluate three MOA classification methodologies using an aquatic toxicity data set of 3448 chemicals, compare the approaches, and assess utility and limitations in screening and early tier assessments. The comparisons focused on three commonly used tools: Verhaar prediction of toxicity MOA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ASsessment Tool for Evaluating Risk (ASTER) QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) application, and the EPA Mode of Action and Toxicity (MOAtox) database. Of the 3448 MOAs predicted using the Verhaar scheme, 1165 were classified by ASTER, and 802 were available in MOAtox. Of the subset of 432 chemicals with MOA assignments for each of the three schemes, 42\% had complete concordance in MOA classification, and there was no agreement for 7\% of the chemicals. The research shows the potential for large differences in MOA classification between the five broad groups of the Verhaar scheme and the more mechanism-based assignments of ASTER and MOAtox. Harmonization of classification schemes is needed to use MOA classification in chemical hazard and risk assessment more broadly.},

	abstract = {In most areas of clinical and preclinical research, the required sample size determines the costs and effort for any project, and thus, optimizing sample size is of primary importance. An experimental design of dose–response studies is determined by the number and choice of dose levels as well as the allocation of sample size to each level. The experimental design of toxicological studies tends to be motivated by convention. Statistical optimal design theory, however, allows the setting of experimental conditions (dose levels, measurement times, etc.) in a way which minimizes the number of required measurements and subjects to obtain the desired precision of the results. While the general theory is well established, the mathematical complexity of the problem so far prevents widespread use of these techniques in practical studies. The paper explains the concepts of statistical optimal design theory with a minimum of mathematical terminology and uses these concepts to generate concrete usable D-optimal experimental designs for dose–response studies on the basis of three common dose–response functions in toxicology: log-logistic, log-normal and Weibull functions with four parameters each. The resulting designs usually require control plus only three dose levels and are quite intuitively plausible. The optimal designs are compared to traditional designs such as the typical setup of cytotoxicity studies for 96-well plates. As the optimal design depends on prior estimates of the dose–response function parameters, it is shown what loss of efficiency occurs if the parameters for design determination are misspecified, and how Bayes optimal designs can improve the situation.},

This model is easily tailored to assess the relative potency of two substances. Consequently, in instances where two such dose response curves are parallel so one substance can be viewed as a dilution of the other, the degree of that dilution is captured in the relative potency model parameter. It is incumbent that experimental researchers working in fields including biomedicine, environmental science, toxicology and applied sciences choose efficient experimental designs to run their studies to both fit their dose response curves and to garner important information regarding drug or substance potency. This article provides far-reaching practical design strategies for dose response model fitting and estimation of relative potency using key illustrations. These results are subsequently extended here to handle situations where the assessment of parallelism and the proper dose-scale are also of interest. Conclusions and recommended strategies are supported by both theoretical and simulation results.},

	abstract = {Acrylamide (AA) exposure causes increased incidence of forestomach, lung, and Harderian gland tumors in male mice. One hypothesized mode of action (MOA) for AA-carcinogenicity includes genotoxicity/mutagenicity as a key event, possibly resulting from AA metabolism to the direct genotoxic metabolite glycidamide. Alternatively, altered calcium signaling (CS) has been proposed as a central key event in the MOA. To examine the plausibility of these proposed MOAs, RNA-sequencing was performed on tumor target tissues: Harderian glands (the most sensitive tumor target tissue in the rodent 2-year cancer bioassay) and lungs of AA-exposed male CD-1 mice. Animals were exposed to 0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, or 24.0 mg AA/kg bw-day in drinking water for 5, 15, or 31 days. We observed a pronounced effect on genes involved in CS and cytoskeletal processes in both tissues, but no evidence supporting a genotoxic MOA. Benchmark dose modeling suggests transcriptional points of departure (PODs) of 0.54 and 2.21 mg/kg bw-day for the Harderian glands and lungs, respectively. These are concordant with PODs of 0.17 and 1.27 mg/kg bw-day derived from the cancer bioassay data for these tissues in male mice, respectively. Overall, this study supports the involvement of CS in AA-induced mouse carcinogenicity, which is consistent with a recently proposed CS-based MOA in rat thyroid, and with other published reports of aberrant CS in malignant tumors in rodents and humans.},

	doi = {10.1080/09553002.2019.1539883},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recently recommended reducing the occupational equivalent dose limit for the lens of the eye. Based primarily on a review of epidemiological data, the absorbed dose threshold is now considered to be 0.5 Gy independent of dose-rate and severity of opacification, reduced from the previous threshold of 2 Gy. However, direct mechanistic evidence to support an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of damage is still lacking. To this end, we explored the effects of a broad dose-range of ionizing radiation exposure on gene expression changes in a human lens epithelial (HLE) cell-line in order to better understand the shape of the dose-response relationship and identify transcriptional thresholds of effects.
METHODS: HLE cells were exposed to doses of 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 2, and 5 Gy of X-ray radiation at two dose rates (1.62 cGy/min and 38.2 cGy/min). Cell culture lysates were collected 20 h post-exposure and analyzed using whole-genome RNA-sequencing. Pathways and dose-thresholds of biological effects were identified using benchmark dose (BMD) modeling.
RESULTS: Transcriptional responses were minimal at doses less than 2 Gy. At higher doses, there were a significant number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (p≤.05, fold change≥{\textbar}1.5{\textbar}) at both dose rates, with 1308 DEGs for the low dose rate (LDR) and 840 DEGs for the high dose rate (HDR) exposure. Dose-response modeling showed that a number of genes exhibited non-linear bi-phasic responses, which was verified by digital droplet PCR. BMD analysis showed the majority of the pathways responded at BMD median values in the dose range of 1.5-2.5 Gy, with the lowest BMD median value being 0.6 Gy for the HDR exposure. The minimum pathway BMD median value for LDR exposure, however, was 2.5 Gy. Although the LDR and HDR exposures shared pathways involved in extracellular matrix reorganization and collagen production with BMD median value of 2.9 Gy, HDR exposures were more effective in activating pathways associated with DNA damage response, apoptosis, and cell cycling relative to LDR exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that radiation induces complex non-linear transcriptional dose-response relationships that are dose-rate dependent. Pathways shared between the two dose rates may be important contributors to radiation-induced cataractogenesis. BMD analysis suggests that the majority of pathways are activated above 0.6 Gy, which supports current ICRP identified dose thresholds for deterministic effects to the lens of the eye of 0.5 Gy.},

Chronic rodent bioassays led to its classification as a group 2B possible human carcinogen due to the induction of liver tumors in rats. We used a toxicogenomics approach in Wistar rats gavaged daily for 7 or 28 days at doses of 300 to 1500 mg/kg/day (mkd) to determine a point of departure (POD) and investigate its mode of action (MoA). Ki67 labeling was increased at doses ≥750 mkd up to 3.3-fold representing the most sensitive apical endpoint. Differential gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq identified 1110 and 1814 differentially expressed genes in male and female rats, respectively, following 28 days of treatment. Down-regulated genes were associated with lipid metabolism while up-regulated genes included cell signaling, immune response, and cell cycle functions. Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling of the Ki67 labeling index determined the BMD10 lower confidence limit (BMDL10) as 190 mkd. Transcriptional BMD modeling revealed excellent concordance between transcriptional POD and apical endpoints. Collectively, these results indicate that acetamide is most likely acting through a mitogenic MoA, though specific key initiating molecular events could not be elucidated. A POD value of 190 mkd determined for cell proliferation is suggested for risk assessment purposes.},

	abstract = {Dose refers to the quantity of a chemical introduced into a biological organism in a given period of time. It can be expressed in many different forms. When a certain dose of therapeutic drug is administered to patients or experimental animals, this external dose does not necessarily reflect the internal exposure or the amount of chemical to which target cells or subcellular organelles are exposed. Statistical analyses are applied to all toxicity data, and individuals representing a population or cohort can show significantly different responses. For almost any medicine, there exists a fraction of the population that is highly susceptible to its toxicity (hypersensitivity) or resistant to toxicity (hypersensitivity). The cumulative dose-response can be used to predict whether a given compound will be harmful or safe at a specific dose and route of administration. Dose-response curves can show a wide variety of complex shapes and slopes that reflect the underlying mechanisms of toxicity. Different reference doses can be determined using a variety of approaches that have different levels of complexity, sensitivity, and significance. While a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) can provide a rapid and rough value for assessing risk, more robust and refined methods are more suitable for setting safe limits in risk assessment for regulatory purposes.},

To keep up with new data and provide a more comprehensive resource for TF research, we updated the Animal Transcription Factor Database (AnimalTFDB) to version 4.0 (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB4/) with up-to-date data and functions. We refined the TF family rules and prediction pipeline to predict TFs in genome-wide protein sequences from Ensembl. As a result, we predicted 274 633 TF genes and 150 726 transcription cofactor genes in AnimalTFDB 4.0 in 183 animal genomes, which are 86 more species than AnimalTFDB 3.0. Besides double data volume, we also added the following new annotations and functions to the database: (i) variations (including mutations) on TF genes in various human cancers and other diseases; (ii) predicted post-translational modification sites (including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination sites) on TFs in 8 species; (iii) TF regulation in autophagy; (iv) comprehensive TF expression annotation for 38 species; (v) exact and batch search functions allow users to search AnimalTFDB flexibly. AnimalTFDB 4.0 is a useful resource for studying TF and transcription regulation, which contains comprehensive annotation and classification of TFs and transcription cofactors.},

The full dataset was subsampled 637 times to generate smaller datasets with different dose ranges and spacing (designs A–E) and number of replicates (n = 2–5). TDRA of the 637 datasets revealed substantial variability in the gene and pathway benchmark doses, but relative stability in overall transcriptomic point-of-departure (tPOD) values when tPODs were calculated with the “pathway” and “mode” methods. Further, we found that tPOD values were more dependent on the dose range and spacing than on the number of replicates, suggesting that optimal experimental designs should use fewer replicates (n = 2 or 3) and more dose groups to reduce uncertainty in the results. Finally, tPOD values ranged by over ten times for all surveyed experimental designs and tPOD types, suggesting that tPODs should be interpreted as order-of-magnitude estimates.},

However, according to our best knowledge, so far oximes have not been quantitatively evaluated by comprehensive benchmark dose (BMD) approach, that would improve both identification and quantification of the effect and allow more rigorous comparison of efficacies. Thus, we have examined in vivo dose-response relationship for two promising experimental oximes, K203 and K027, concerning reactivation of erythrocyte AChE inhibited by dichlorvos (DDVP). Groups of Wistar rats were treated with six different doses of oximes (i.m) immediately after DDVP challenge (s.c) and AChE was measured 60 min later. Dose-response modeling was done by PROAST software 65.5 (RIVM, The Nederlands). BMD-covariate method resulted in four-parameter model from both exponential and Hill model families as the best estimate of relationship between AChE activity and oxime dose, with potency parameter being oxime-dependent. Oxime K027 was shown to be 1.929-fold more potent considering that 58\% increase in AChE activity was achived with the dose BMD58-K027 = 52 μmol/kg in contrast to BMD58-K203 = 100 μmol/kg.},

Phenobarbital (PB) is a prototypical nongenotoxic carcinogen that activates the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) resulting in rodent liver tumors. In this study, male and female CD-1 mice administered dietary PB at 0, 0.15, 1.5, 15, 75, or 150 mg/kg-day for 2 or 7 days to characterize multiple apical and molecular endpoints below, at (∼75 mg/kg-day), and above the carcinogenic dose level of PB and examine these responses using benchmark dose modeling. Linear toxicokinetics were observed for all doses. Increased liver weight, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and mitotic figures were seen at 75 and 150 mg/kg-day. CAR activation, based on Cyp2b qPCR and pentoxyresorufin dealkylase activity, occurred at doses ≥ 1.5 mg/kg-day. The no-observable transcriptional effect level for global gene expression was 15 mg/kg-day. At 2 days, several xenobiotic metabolism and cell protective pathways were activated at lower doses and to a greater degree in females. However, hepatocellular proliferation, quantified by bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry, was the most sensitive indicator of PB exposure with female mice more sensitive than males, contrary to sex-specific differences in sensitivity to hepatocarcinogenesis. Taken together, the identification of low-dose cellular and molecular transitions in the subtumorigenic dose range aids the understanding of early key events in CAR-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Recent screening of Atlantic salmon feeds has uncovered residues of several pesticides, including pirimiphos-methyl. Pirimiphos-methyl is an organophosphate (OP) insecticide, causing inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in target organisms. The aim of this study was to examine pirimiphos-methyl non-targeted mode of action toxicity in Atlantic salmon using in vitro exposure. Hepatocyte cells were exposed to pirimiphos-methyl (control-0.1-1.0-10-100-1000μM) for 48h. Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and non-targeted metabolomics were used to screen for effects of the pesticide. The results showed that the compound acts cytotoxic and impacts accumulation of lipids (steatosis) at 1000μM. Metabolomics screening revealed effects on lipid metabolism (diHOME fatty acids, cholesterol and lysophospholipids), glutathione (depletion), glycolysis and tryptophan metabolism, as well as on several vitamins. At 1000μM, vitamin E levels increased, while folate and thiamine derivate levels decreased. Surprisingly few transcripts were affected by the treatment, with only 64 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showing a clear dose-dependent response. Several DEGs encoding proteins in cholesterol biosynthesis showed negative correlations with pirimiphos-methyl exposure. Other affected DEGs indicate an estrogenic effect, and points to mitochondrial dysfunction at the highest dose. The finding suggests that glutathione and glycine conjugation reactions are involved in the detoxification process. In conclusion, this study shows that pirimiphos-methyl is a relatively potent toxicant in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes affecting lipid and vitamin metabolism as well as glutathione turn-over.},

Though hydrazine is positive in both in vitro and in vivo DNA strand break (comet) assays, hydrazine was reported to be negative in an in vitro mutation Muta Mouse lung epithelial cell (FE1) test, as well as in a regulatory-compliant, in vivo Big Blue mouse mutation test. In this article, mechanistic studies explored the cellular response to hydrazine. When tested in a regulatory-compliant mouse lymphoma assay, hydrazine yielded unusual, weakly positive results. This prompted an investigation into the transcriptional response to hydrazine in FE1 cells via RNA sequencing. Amongst the changes identified was a dose-dependent increase in G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation associated genes. Flow cytometric experiments in FE1 cells revealed that hydrazine exposure led to S-phase cell cycle arrest. Clonogenic assays in a variety of cell lines harboring key DNA repair protein deficiencies indicated that hydrazine could sensitize cells lacking homology dependent repair proteins (Brca2 and Fancg). Lastly, hprt assays with hydrazine were conducted to determine whether a lack of DNA repair could lead to mutagenicity. However, no robust, dose-dependent induction of mutations was noted. The transcriptional and cell cycle response to hydrazine, coupled with functional investigations of DNA repair-deficient cell lines support the inconsistencies noted in the genetic toxicology regulatory battery. In summary, while hydrazine may be genotoxic, transcriptional and functional processes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair appear to play a nuanced role in mediating the mutagenic potential.},

	abstract = {Haemaphysalis longicornis is an ixodid tick species of medical and veterinary importance. Investigation into the acaricidal activities of botanicals have increased recently but information about their molecular mechanism of action is scarce. Here, RNA-seq analysis of the ticks exposed to Cymbopogon citratus essential oil and citronellal was performed and the responsive genes were identified. More than 6.39 G clean reads with Q20 ≥ 94.88\% were obtained for each H. longicornis sample, with an average GC content of 50.94\%. Using the Trinity method, 166,710 unigenes with a mean length of 869 bp and a maximum contig length of 29,156 bp were obtained. The upregulation of genes was concentration-dependent in most of the treated groups. Many genes responsive to C. citratus oil and citronellal were stress-related and they include genes associated with adrenergic signaling/calcium channels, cGMP-PKG signaling, apoptosis, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mTOR signaling pathway, and longevity regulating pathway. The upregulation of genes (CACNAID, ADCY9, TPM1, and MYH6) associated with calcium channels suggests a neurotoxic mode of action, whereas, the upregulation of apoptosis-associated genes (CYC, DRONC, CASP7, CASP9, BCL2L1, bcl-xL, etc.) suggests a cytotoxic mode of action. The metabolism of C. citratus essential oil generates oxidative stress which increases the intra-mitochondrial free Ca2+ and triggers the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that culminates to mitochondrial depolarization, ATP depletion, and either necrotic or apoptotic death. The neurotoxic and cytotoxic effects exhibited by the monoterpenes in H. longicornis is vital and could be exploited for the advancement of acaricide development and eco-friendly tick control.},

	abstract = {Cardiac remodeling results from both physiological and pathological stimuli. Compared with mammalian hearts, fish hearts show a broader array of remodeling changes in response to environmental influences, providing exceptional models for dissecting the molecular and cellular bases of cardiac remodeling. We recently characterized a form of pathological remodeling in juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in response to crude oil exposure during embryonic cardiogenesis. In the absence of overt pathology (cardiomyocyte death or inflammatory infiltrate), cardiac ventricles in exposed fish showed altered shape, reduced thickness of compact myocardium and hypertrophic changes in spongy, trabeculated myocardium. Here, we used RNA sequencing to characterize molecular pathways underlying these defects. In juvenile ventricular cardiomyocytes, antecedent embryonic oil exposure led to dose-dependent upregulation of genes involved in innate immunity and two NKX homeobox transcription factors not previously associated with cardiomyocytes, nkx2.3 and nkx3.3 Absent from mammalian genomes, the latter is largely uncharacterized. In zebrafish embryos, nkx3.3 demonstrated a potent effect on cardiac morphogenesis, equivalent to that of nkx2.5, the primary transcription factor associated with ventricular cardiomyocyte identity. The role of nkx3.3 in heart growth is potentially linked to the unique regenerative capacity of fish and amphibians. Moreover, these findings support a cardiomyocyte-intrinsic role for innate immune response genes in pathological hypertrophy. This study demonstrates how an expanding mechanistic understanding of environmental pollution impacts - i.e. the chemical perturbation of biological systems - can ultimately yield new insights into fundamental biological processes.},

This research aims to investigate the health effects of copper exposure on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) under the existing environmental quality standards (1 mg/L and 2 mg/L) via lifespan, reproduction, biological markers and transcriptome analysis. The results showed that copper of these two environmental standards shorten the lifespan of nematodes, reduced the brood size, reduced the frequency of pharyngeal pumps and prolonged defecation time as aging-related behaviors, and increased the levels of aging-related markers ROS, MDA and H2O2. There was a certain effect trend for the two exposure concentrations. Further, the possible molecular mechanism of copper-induced aging and reproductive effects on C. elegans was explored. Differential gene expression analysis was performed, and 2332 genes (567 up- and 1765 down-regulated genes) in the 1 mg/L group, 2449 DEGs (724 up- and 1725 down-regulated genes) in the 2 mg/L group in response to copper treatment. The top 20 regulated genes were vit (vit-1, vit-3, vit-4) genes, col genes (col-35, col-72, col-114, col-123, col-164, col-183, col-185), eea-1, him-18 and grl-20, which suggested that cuticle collagen synthesis and yolk expression were disrupted by copper. Analysis of KEGG pathway showed copper exposure widely affects longevity regulation pathways, thereby promoting aging. In summary, the sequencing results extensively and deeply reveal the health hazards of environmentally relevant doses of copper exposure to C. elegans, and behavioral testing verified that copper promoted aging of C. elegans.},

These models can be used to estimate the effective dose corresponding to a 5\% excess risk for both these toxicological endpoints, as well as for overall toxicity. In this article, we develop optimal experimental designs for the estimation of the effective dose for developmental toxicity using joint Weibull dose‐response models for prenatal death and fetal malformation. Based on an extended series of developmental studies, near‐optimal designs for prenatal death, malformation, and overall toxicity were found to involve three dose groups: an unexposed control group, a high dose equal to the maximum tolerated dose, and a low dose above or comparable to the effective dose. The effect on the optimal designs of changing the number of implants and the degree of intra‐litter correlation is also investigated. Although the optimal design has only three dose groups in most cases, practical considerations involving model lack of fit and estimation of the shape of the dose‐response curve suggest that, in practice, suboptimal designs with more than three doses will often be preferred.},

While many posttranslational regulators of nSMase2 are known, emerging evidence suggests a more protracted regulation of nSMase2 at the transcriptional level. Previously, we reported that nSMase2 is induced by all-\textit{trans} retinoic acid (ATRA) in MCF7 cells and implicated nSMase2 in ATRA-induced growth arrest. Here, we further investigated how ATRA regulates nSMase2. We find that ATRA regulates nSMase2 transcriptionally through the retinoic acid receptor-α, but this is independent of previously identified transcriptional regulators of nSMase2 (Sp1, Sp3, Runx2) and is not through increased promoter activity. Epigenetically, the nSMase2 gene is not repressively methylated in MCF7 cells. However, inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with trichostatin A (TSA) induced nSMase2 comparably to ATRA; furthermore, combined ATRA and TSA treatment was not additive, suggesting ATRA regulates nSMase2 through direct modulation of histone acetylation. Confirming this, the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein and p300 were required for ATRA induction of nSMase2. Finally, use of class-specific HDAC inhibitors suggested that HDAC4 and/or HDAC5 are negative regulators of nSMase2 expression. Collectively, these results identify a novel pathway of nSMase2 regulation and suggest that physiological or pharmacological modulation of histone acetylation can directly affect nSMase2 levels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Sphingolipids play important roles in regulating cellular responses. Although mitochondria contain sphingolipids, direct regulation of their levels in mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes is mostly unclear. Neutral SMase (N-SMase) isoforms, which catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and phosphocholine, have been found in the mitochondria of yeast and zebrafish, yet their existence in mammalian mitochondria remains unknown. Here, we have identified and cloned a cDNA based on nSMase homologous sequences. This cDNA encodes a novel protein of 483 amino acids that displays significant homology to nSMase2 and possesses the same catalytic core residues as members of the extended N-SMase family. A transiently expressed V5-tagged protein co-localized with both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum markers in MCF-7 and HEK293 cells; accordingly, the enzyme is referred to as mitochondria-associated nSMase (MA-nSMase). MA-nSMase was highly expressed in testis, pancreas, epididymis, and brain. MA-nSMase had an absolute requirement for cations such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) and activation by the anionic phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine and the mitochondrial cardiolipin. Importantly, overexpression of MA-nSMase in HEK293 cells significantly increased in vitro N-SMase activity and also modulated the levels of SM and ceramide, indicating that the identified cDNA encodes a functional SMase. Thus, these studies identify and characterize, for the first time, a mammalian MA-nSMase. The characterization of MA-nSMase described here will contribute to our understanding of pathways regulated by sphingolipid metabolites, particularly with reference to the mitochondria and associated organelles.},

	abstract = {In the toxicological regime, the toxicological endpoint and its dose-response relationship are two of the most prominent characters in conducting a risk assessment for chemical exposure. Systems biological methods have been used to comprehensively characterize the impact of toxicants on the biochemical pathways. However, the majority of the current studies are only based on single-dose, and limited information can be extrapolated to other doses from these experiments, regardless of the sensitivity of each endpoint. This study aims to understand the dose-response metabolite dysregulation pattern and metabolite sensitivity at the system-biological level. Here, we applied bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), as the model chemical. We first employed the global metabolomics method to characterize the metabolome of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) upon exposure to different doses (0, 20, 50, and 100 µM) of BPA. The dysregulated features with a clear dose-response relationship were also effectively picked up with an R-package named TOXcms. Overall, most metabolites were dysregulated by showing a significant dose-dependent behaviour. The results suggested that BPA exposure greatly perturbed purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. Interestingly, most metabolites within the purine metabolism were described as a biphasic dose-response relationship. With the established dose-response relationship, we were able to fully map the metabolite cartography of BPA exposure within a wide range of concentrations and observe some unique patterns. Furthermore, an effective concentration of certain fold changes (e.g., EC+10 means the dose at which metabolite is 10\% upregulated) and metabolite sensitivity were defined and introduced to this dose-response omics information. The result showed that the purine metabolism pathway is the most venerable target of BPA, which can be a potential endogenous biomarker for its exposure. Overall, this study applied the dose-response metabolomics method to fully understand the biochemical pathway disruption of BPA treatment at different doses. Both dose-response omics strategy and metabolite sensitivity analysis can be further considered and emphasized in future chemical risk assessments.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {The Scientific Committee (SC) reconfirms that the benchmark dose (BMD) approach is a scientifically more advanced method compared to the NOAEL approach for deriving a Reference Point (RP). Most of the modifications made to the SC guidance of 2009 concern the section providing guidance on how to apply the BMD approach. Model averaging is recommended as the preferred method for calculating the BMD confidence interval, while acknowledging that the respective tools are still under development and may not be easily accessible to all. Therefore, selecting or rejecting models is still considered as a suboptimal alternative. The set of default models to be used for BMD analysis has been reviewed, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) has been introduced instead of the log-likelihood to characterise the goodness of fit of different mathematical models to a dose–response data set. A flowchart has also been inserted in this update to guide the reader step-by-step when performing a BMD analysis, as well as a chapter on the distributional part of dose–response models and a template for reporting a BMD analysis in a complete and transparent manner. Finally, it is recommended to always report the BMD confidence interval rather than the value of the BMD. The lower bound (BMDL) is needed as a potential RP, and the upper bound (BMDU) is needed for establishing the BMDU/BMDL per ratio reflecting the uncertainty in the BMD estimate. This updated guidance does not call for a general re-evaluation of previous assessments where the NOAEL approach or the BMD approach as described in the 2009 SC guidance was used, in particular when the exposure is clearly smaller (e.g. more than one order of magnitude) than the health-based guidance value. Finally, the SC firmly reiterates to reconsider test guidelines given the expected wide application of the BMD approach.},

	abstract = {Since the initial publication of clusterMaker, the need for tools to analyze large biological datasets has only increased. New datasets are significantly larger than a decade ago, and new experimental techniques such as single-cell transcriptomics continue to drive the need for clustering or classification techniques to focus on portions of datasets of interest. While many libraries and packages exist that implement various algorithms, there remains the need for clustering packages that are easy to use, integrated with visualization of the results, and integrated with other commonly used tools for biological data analysis. clusterMaker2 has added several new algorithms, including two entirely new categories of analyses: node ranking and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, many of the new algorithms have been implemented using the Cytoscape jobs API, which provides a mechanism for executing remote jobs from within Cytoscape. Together, these advances facilitate meaningful analyses of modern biological datasets despite their ever-increasing size and complexity.},

	abstract = {Transcriptomics data are relevant to address a number of challenges in Toxicogenomics (TGx). After careful planning of exposure conditions and data preprocessing, the TGx data can be used in predictive toxicology, where more advanced modelling techniques are applied. The large volume of molecular profiles produced by omics-based technologies allows the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in TGx. Indeed, the publicly available omics datasets are constantly increasing together with a plethora of different methods that are made available to facilitate their analysis, interpretation and the generation of accurate and stable predictive models. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art of data modelling applied to transcriptomics data in TGx. We show how the benchmark dose (BMD) analysis can be applied to TGx data. We review read across and adverse outcome pathways (AOP) modelling methodologies. We discuss how network-based approaches can be successfully employed to clarify the mechanism of action (MOA) or specific biomarkers of exposure. We also describe the main AI methodologies applied to TGx data to create predictive classification and regression models and we address current challenges. Finally, we present a short description of deep learning (DL) and data integration methodologies applied in these contexts. Modelling of TGx data represents a valuable tool for more accurate chemical safety assessment. This review is the third part of a three-article series on Transcriptomics in Toxicogenomics.},

	abstract = {The basis of ecotoxicology lies currently in the dose–response of organisms to toxicants, as typically described by probit and logistic models. While recognising its merits, standard endpoints ignore the process of toxicity with time, and consequently our ability to predict direct toxic effects in environmental risk assessments is seriously curtailed. Although the response of toxicants with time has been studied before, its application in ecotoxicology remains underutilised. One reason is that no convincing mechanism has been proposed to explain the hyperbolic curves of such responses, whereas a variety of models have been used to describe them. The explanation of both time- and dose-dependent responses is found ultimately in the natural variability of receptor sites among individuals of populations exposed to a toxicant inhibitor with time. The process can be explained by the kinetics of inhibition, and is appropriately described by a simple mathematical expression like the Michaelis–Menten equation, though other asymptotic models (e.g. logistic model) can also be used. The advantage of the hyperbolic model is that median effect values (e.g. LC50 for dose- and ET50 for time-dependent responses) enable calculation of toxicity effects at any concentration level and/or time of exposure, thus making it especially attractive for risk assessment.},

	abstract = {A Hill-type time-response curve was derived using a single-step chemical kinetics approximation. The rate expression for the transformation is a differential equation that provides an interpolation formula between the logistic growth curve and second order kinetics. The solution is equivalent to the log-logistic cumulative distribution function with the time constant expressed in terms of a kinetic rate constant. This expression was extended to a full dose-time-response equation by postulating a concentration dependence for the rate constant. This was achieved by invoking a modified form of Haber’s law that connects an observed toxic effect with the concentration of the active agent and the elapsed exposure time. Analysis showed that the concept of Concentration Addition corresponds to a special case where the rate constant for the overall transformation rate is proportional to the sum of the rate constants that apply when the agents act individually. Biodiesel “survival” curves were measured and used to test the applicability of the empirical model to describe the effects of inhibitor dosage and binary inhibitor mixtures. Positive results suggest that the proposed dose-response relationship for the toxicity of agents to organisms can be extended to inanimate systems especially in cases where accurate mechanistic models are lacking.},

By fitting a concentration-response curve, one can derive target concentrations, such as the EC50. In practice, concentration-response data for different exposure durations might be available and the target concentration for each or some exposure duration(s) are of interest. In this work, we propose a statistical modeling approach that improves the precision of the target concentration estimation at a given exposure duration by extrapolating the concentration-response data from other exposure durations. The method further enables target concentration estimation at exposure durations that were not conducted in the experiment. For practitioners, the proposed model yields additional complexity compared to the simple approach of a single concentration-response curve for all exposure durations. It would only be used if it improves the estimation of the target concentration compared to the simple approach. We propose a two-step pipeline to decide between using the complex and the simple approach to result in a precise target concentra­ tion estimation.},

Such results will be reliable because they will cover multidirectional methods and approaches. The analysis of currently available results already provided with the conclusion that often single omics approach does not correspond with other expected information and may bring misinterpretations. That is why the integration of several “omics” is useful for searching entire explanations and answers as well as appropriate interpretation of obtained complex results. The hypothesis was stated that “from transcriptomics can not be concluded to proteomics”. This review focuses on the reasons for the integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and other—omics analysis.

	abstract = {DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology and biomedical sciences, sequencing full genomes and transcriptomes at very high speeds and reasonably low costs. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) enables transcript identification and quantification, but once sequencing has concluded researchers can be easily overwhelmed with questions such as how to go from raw data to differential expression (DE), pathway analysis and interpretation. Several pipelines and procedures have been developed to this effect. Even though there is no unique way to perform RNA-Seq analysis, it usually follows these steps: 1) raw reads quality check, 2) alignment of reads to a reference genome, 3) aligned reads’ summarization according to an annotation file, 4) DE analysis and 5) gene set analysis and/or functional enrichment analysis. Each step requires researchers to make decisions, and the wide variety of options and resulting large volumes of data often lead to interpretation challenges. There also seems to be insufficient guidance on how best to obtain relevant information and derive actionable knowledge from transcription experiments. In this paper, we explain RNA-Seq steps in detail and outline differences and similarities of different popular options, as well as advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss non-coding RNA analysis, multi-omics, meta-transcriptomics and the use of artificial intelligence methods complementing the arsenal of tools available to researchers. Lastly, we perform a complete analysis from raw reads to DE and functional enrichment analysis, visually illustrating how results are not absolute truths and how algorithmic decisions can greatly impact results and interpretation.},

	abstract = {Gene-set analysis (GSA) is a standard procedure for exploring potential biological functions of a group of genes. The development of its methodology has been an active research topic in recent decades. Many GSA methods, when newly proposed, rely on simulation studies to evaluate their performance with an implicit assumption that the multivariate expression values are normally distributed. This assumption is commonly adopted in GSAs, particularly those in the group of functional class scoring (FCS) methods. The validity of the normality assumption, however, has been disputed in several studies, yet no systematic analysis has been carried out to assess the effect of this distributional assumption. Our goal in this study is not to propose a new GSA method but to first examine if the multi-dimensional gene expression data in gene sets follow a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution. Six statistical methods in three categories of MVN tests were considered and applied to a total of 24 RNA data sets. These RNA values were collected from cancer patients as well as normal subjects, and the values were derived from microarray experiments, RNA sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Our first finding suggests that the MVN assumption is not always satisfied. This assumption does not hold true in many applications tested here. In the second part of this research, we evaluated the influence of non-normality on the statistical power of current FCS methods, both parametric and nonparametric ones. Specifically, the scenario of mixture distributions representing more than one population for the RNA values was considered. This second investigation demonstrates that the non-normality distribution of the RNA values causes a loss in the statistical power of these GSA tests, especially when subtypes exist. Among the FCS GSA tools examined here and among the scenarios studied in this research, the N-statistics outperform the others. Based on the results from these two investigations, we conclude that the assumption of MVN should be used with caution when evaluating new GSA tools, since this assumption cannot be guaranteed and violation may lead to spurious results, loss of power, and incorrect comparison between methods. If a newly proposed GSA tool is to be evaluated, we recommend the incorporation of a wide range of multivariate non-normal distributions or sampling from large databases if available.},

	abstract = {Functional analysis of gene sets derived from experiments is typically done by pathway annotation. Although many algorithms exist for analyzing the association between a gene set and a pathway, an issue which is generally ignored is that gene sets often represent multiple pathways. In such cases an association to a pathway is weakened by the presence of genes associated with other pathways. A way to counteract this is to cluster the gene set into more homogenous parts before performing pathway analysis on each module. We explored whether network-based pre-clustering of a query gene set can improve pathway analysis. The methods MCL, Infomap, and MGclus were used to cluster the gene set projected onto the FunCoup network. We characterized how well these methods are able to detect individual pathways in multi-pathway gene sets, and applied each of the clustering methods in combination with four pathway analysis methods: Gene Enrichment Analysis, BinoX, NEAT, and ANUBIX. Using benchmarks constructed from the KEGG pathway database we found that clustering can be beneficial by increasing the sensitivity of pathway analysis methods and by providing deeper insights of biological mechanisms related to the phenotype under study. However, keeping a high specificity is a challenge. For ANUBIX, clustering caused a minor loss of specificity, while for BinoX and NEAT it caused an unacceptable loss of specificity. GEA had very low sensitivity both before and after clustering. The choice of clustering method only had a minor effect on the results. We show examples of this approach and conclude that clustering can improve overall pathway annotation performance, but should only be used if the used enrichment method has a low false positive rate.

	abstract = {Background: Omics technologies have been widely applied in toxicology studies in order to investigate the effects of different substances on exposed biological systems. A classical toxicogenomic study consists in testing the effects of a compound at different dose levels and different time points. The main challenge consists in identifying the gene alteration patterns that are correlated to doses and time points. The majority of existing methods for toxicogenomics data analysis allow studying molecular alteration after the exposure (or treatment) at each time point individually. However, this kind of analysis is not able to identify dynamic (time-depended) events of dose responsiveness.
Results: We propose TinderMIX, an approach that simultaneously models the effects of time and dose on the transcriptome to investigate the course of molecular alterations exerted in response to the exposure. Starting from gene log-fold-change, TinderMIX fits different integrated time and dose models to each gene, selects the optimal one, and computes its time and dose effect map; then a user-selected threshold is applied to identify the responsive area on each map and verify if the gene shows a dynamic (time-dependent) and dose-dependent response; eventually, responsive genes are labelled according to the integrated time and dose point of departure (POD).
Conclusions: To showcase the TinderMIX method, we analyzed two drugs from the Open TG-GATEs dataset, namely cyclosporin A and thioacetamide. We first identified the dynamic dose-dependent mechanism of action (MOA) of each drug and compared them. Our analysis highlights that different time and dose integrated POD recapitulates the toxicity potential of the compounds as well as their dynamic dose-dependent MOA.},

The most common approach to in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses involves sequential analysis of the plasma concentration- and response-time data, such that the plasma kinetic model provides an independent function, driving the dynamics. However, in situations when plasma sampling may jeopardize the effect measurements or is scarce, nonexistent, or unlinked to the effect (e.g., in intensive care units, pediatric or frail elderly populations, or drug discovery), focusing on the response-time course alone may be an adequate alternative for pharmacodynamic analyses. Response-time data inherently contain useful information about the turnover characteristics of response (target turnover rate, half-life of response), as well as the drug’s biophase kinetics (biophase availability, absorption half-life, and disposition half-life) pharmacodynamic properties (potency, efficacy). The use of pharmacodynamic time-response data circumvents the need for a direct assay method for the drug and has the additional advantage of being applicable to cases of local drug administration close to its intended targets in the immediate vicinity of target, or when target precedes systemic plasma concentrations. This review exemplifies the potential of biophase functions in pharmacodynamic analyses in both preclinical and clinical studies, with the purpose of characterizing response data and optimizing subsequent study protocols. This article illustrates crucial determinants to the success of modeling dose-response-time (DRT) data, such as the dose selection, repeated dosing, and different input rates and routes. Finally, a literature search was also performed to gauge how frequently this technique has been applied in preclinical and clinical studies. This review highlights situations in which DRT should be carefully scrutinized and discusses future perspectives of the field.},

A major decision with respect to the statistical analysis is whether to consider only the actually measured concentrations or to assume an underlying (parametric) model that allows extrapolation. Recent research suggests the application of modelling approaches for various types of toxicological assays. However, there is a discrepancy between the state of the art in statistical methodological research and published analyses in the toxicological literature. The extent of this gap is quantified in this work using an extensive literature review that considered all dose–response analyses published in three major toxicological journals in 2021. The aspects of the review include biological considerations (type of assay and of exposure), statistical design considerations (number of measured conditions, design, and sample sizes), and statistical analysis considerations (display, analysis goal, statistical testing or modelling method, and alert concentration). Based on the results of this review and the critical assessment of three selected issues in the context of statistical research, concrete guidance for planning, execution, and analysis of dose–response studies from a statistical viewpoint is proposed.},

Coupled to dose-response experimental designs, they allow a non-targeted assessment of organism responses at the molecular level along an exposure gradient. However, describing the dose-response relationships on such high-throughput data is no easy task. In a first part, we review the software available for this purpose, and their main features. We set out arguments on some statistical and modeling choices we have made while developing the R package DRomics and its positioning compared to others tools. The DRomics main analysis workflow is made available through a web interface, namely a shiny app named DRomics-shiny. Next, we present the new functionalities recently implemented. DRomics has been augmented especially to be able to handle varied omics data considering the nature of the measured signal (e.g. counts of reads in RNAseq) and the way data were collected (e.g. batch effect, situation with no experimental replicates). Another important upgrade is the development of tools to ease the biological interpretation of results. Various functions are proposed to visualize, summarize and compare the responses, for different biological groups (defined from biological annotation), optionally at different experimental levels (e.g. measurements at several omics level or in different experimental conditions). A new shiny app named DRomicsInterpreter-shiny is dedicated to the biological interpretation of results. The institutional web page https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/fr/dromics gathers links to all resources related to DRomics, including the two shiny applications.},

	abstract = {Functional enrichment analysis or pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) is a bioinformatics technique which identifies the most over-represented biological pathways in a list of genes compared to those that would be associated with them by chance. These biological functions are found on bioinformatics annotated databases such as The Gene Ontology or KEGG; the more abundant pathways are identified through statistical techniques such as Fisher’s exact test. All PEA tools require a list of genes as input. A few tools, however, read lists of genomic regions as input rather than lists of genes, and first associate these chromosome regions with their corresponding genes. These tools perform a procedure called genomic regions enrichment analysis, which can be useful for detecting the biological pathways related to a set of chromosome regions. In this brief survey, we analyze six tools for genomic regions enrichment analysis (BEHST, g:Profiler g:GOSt, GREAT, LOLA, Poly-Enrich, and ReactomePA), outlining and comparing their main features. Our comparison results indicate that the inclusion of data for regulatory elements, such as ChIP-seq, is common among these tools and could therefore improve the enrichment analysis results.},

The two major goals of metabolomics are the identification of the metabolites characterizing each organism state and the measurement of their dynamics under different situations (e.g. pathological conditions, environmental factors). Knowledge about metabolites is crucial for the understanding of most cellular phenomena, but this information alone is not sufficient to gain a comprehensive view of all the biological processes involved. Integrated approaches combining metabolomics with transcriptomics and proteomics are thus required to obtain much deeper insights than any of these techniques alone. Although this information is available, multilevel integration of different ‘omics’ data is still a challenge. The handling, processing, analysis and integration of these data require specialized mathematical, statistical and bioinformatics tools, and several technical problems hampering a rapid progress in the field exist. Here, we review four main tools for number of users or provided features (MetaCoreTM, MetaboAnalyst, InCroMAP and 3Omics) out of the several available for metabolomic data analysis and integration with other ‘omics’ data, highlighting their strong and weak aspects; a number of related issues affecting data analysis and integration are also identified and discussed. Overall, we provide an objective description of how some of the main currently available software packages work, which may help the experimental practitioner in the choice of a robust pipeline for metabolomic data analysis and integration.},

	abstract = {Most high throughput genomic data analysis pipelines currently rely on over-representation or gene set enrichment analysis (ORA/GSEA) approaches for functional analysis. In contrast, topology-based pathway analysis methods, which offer a more biologically informed perspective by incorporating interaction and topology information, have remained underutilized and inaccessible due to various limiting factors. These methods heavily rely on the quality of pathway topologies and often utilize predefined topologies from databases without assessing their correctness. To address these issues and make topology-aware pathway analysis more accessible and flexible, we introduce the PSF (Pathway Signal Flow) toolkit R package. Our toolkit integrates pathway curation and topology-based analysis, providing interactive and command-line tools that facilitate pathway importation, correction, and modification from diverse sources. This enables users to perform topology-based pathway signal flow analysis in both interactive and command-line modes. To showcase the toolkit’s usability, we curated 36 KEGG signaling pathways and conducted several use-case studies, comparing our method with ORA and the topology-based signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) method. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively identify ORA enriched pathways while providing more detailed branch-level information. Moreover, in contrast to the SPIA method, it offers the advantage of being cut-off free and less susceptible to the variability caused by selection thresholds. By combining pathway curation and topology-based analysis, the PSF toolkit enhances the quality, flexibility, and accessibility of topology-aware pathway analysis. Researchers can now easily import pathways from various sources, correct and modify them as needed, and perform detailed topology-based pathway signal flow analysis. In summary, our PSF toolkit offers an integrated solution that addresses the limitations of current topology-based pathway analysis methods. By providing interactive and command-line tools for pathway curation and topology-based analysis, we empower researchers to conduct comprehensive pathway analyses across a wide range of applications.},

	abstract = {Pathway analysis has been widely used to detect pathways and functions associated with complex disease phenotypes. The proliferation of this approach is due to better interpretability of its results and its higher statistical power compared with the gene-level statistics. A plethora of pathway analysis methods that utilize multi-omics setup, rather than just transcriptomics or proteomics, have recently been developed to discover novel pathways and biomarkers. Since multi-omics gives multiple views into the same problem, different approaches are employed in aggregating these views into a comprehensive biological context. As a result, a variety of novel hypotheses regarding disease ideation and treatment targets can be formulated. In this article, we review 32 such pathway analysis methods developed for multi-omics and multi-cohort data. We discuss their availability and implementation, assumptions, supported omics types and databases, pathway analysis techniques and integration strategies. A comprehensive assessment of each method’s practicality, and a thorough discussion of the strengths and drawbacks of each technique will be provided. The main objective of this survey is to provide a thorough examination of existing methods to assist potential users and researchers in selecting suitable tools for their data and analysis purposes, while highlighting outstanding challenges in the field that remain to be addressed for future development.},

In addition, the zebrafish shares a high degree of homology with the human genome. It has become a powerful model organism for genetics, development, environmental toxicology, several human diseases and pharmacology. Zebrafish bioassays can be used for environmental monitoring including pollutant evaluations, such as toxic heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, and organic pollutants. The large number of transparent embryos gained from zebrafish females, in vitro and rapid embryonic development and ready-to-use methods of biotechnology enables us to use mostly automatized high-throughput screening not only in pharmaceutical drug development protocols but in aquatic ecotoxicology as well.},

The aim of this bioinformatics-assisted review was twofold; (i) to update the current knowledge of Fe metabolism and its relationship to the immune system, and (ii) to perform a prediction analysis of regulatory network hubs that might serve as potential biomarkers during stress-induced immunosuppression. Several literature and bioinformatics databases/repositories were utilized to review Fe metabolism and complement the molecular description of prioritized proteins. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) was used to build a protein-protein interactions network for subsequent network topology analysis. Importantly, Fe is a sensitive double-edged sword where two extremes of its nutritional status may have harmful effects on innate and adaptive immunity. We identified clearly connected important hubs that belong to two clusters: (i) presentation of peptide antigens to the immune system with the involvement of redox reactions of Fe, heme, and Fe trafficking/transport; and (ii) ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation processes of proteins related to Fe metabolism in immune cells (e.g., macrophages). The identified potential biomarkers were in agreement with the current experimental evidence, are included in several immunological/biomarkers databases, and/or are emerging genetic markers for different stressful conditions. Although further validation is warranted, this hybrid method (human-machine collaboration) to extract meaningful biological applications using available data in literature and bioinformatics tools should be highlighted.},

We compared the ability of these methods to detect DE genes in terms of the significance ranking of genes and false discovery rate control. All methods compared are implemented in freely available software. We also discuss the availability and functions of the currently available versions of these software.},

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

Thus, mechanistic pathway activity (MPA) methods constitute a new paradigm that allows recoding poorly informative genomic measurements into cell activity quantitative values and relate them to phenotypes.

	abstract = {Background. Notwithstanding the mounting evidence to suggest that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are yet to be completely understood. This research examined the molecular mechanism behind this vascular complication. Methods. The Gene Expression Omnibus database was retrieved to acquire the gene expression datasets for SLE (GSE109248) and atherosclerosis (GSE100927). The shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SLE and atherosclerosis were screened with the help of the “limma” package in R software, followed by function enrichment analysis, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction, key module analysis, hub gene selection, and coexpression analysis. Results. In GSE109248 and GSE100927, 1195 and 418 DEGs in totals were identified, respectively. Subsequently, we acquired 78 common DEGs (70 upregulated genes and eight downregulated genes) with the same expression trends by using the Venn diagram. Finally, 12 hub genes, including PTPRC, TYROBP, FCGR3A, ITGAX, LCP2, IL1B, IRF8, LILRB2, CD68, C1QB, CCR7, and C1QA were identified by using seven different algorithms in Cytohubba. The functional analysis illustrates that these genes were predominantly enriched in immune and inflammation response, lipid and atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis. These results indicate an important role of SLE in inducing excessive inflammation, which may be medicate by these hub genes and can induce osteoporosis and imbalance of the normal mineral balance in the body as well as lipid abnormalities, which eventually leads to premature onset of atherosclerosis. In total, nine transcription factors (TFs) that may participate in regulating the function of these genes were identified. All hub genes and four TFs were validated successfully. Conclusion. The results of our research show that SLE and atherosclerosis have common DEGs, pathophysiology, and hub genes. These findings can provide fresh evidence and insights into a further investigation into the mechanisms at play.},

	abstract = {Circadian entrainment to the environmental day–night cycle is essential for the optimal use of environmental resources. In insects, opsin-based photoreception in the compound eye and ocelli and CRYPTOCHROME1 (CRY1) in circadian clock neurons are thought to be involved in sensing photic information, but the genetic regulation of circadian light entrainment in species without light-sensitive CRY1 remains unclear. To elucidate a possible CRY1-independent light transduction cascade, we analyzed light-induced gene expression through RNA-sequencing in Nasonia vitripennis. Entrained wasps were subjected to a light pulse in the subjective night to reset the circadian clock, and light-induced changes in gene expression were characterized at four different time points in wasp heads. We used co-expression, functional annotation, and transcription factor binding motif analyses to gain insight into the molecular pathways in response to acute light stimulus and to form hypotheses about the circadian light-resetting pathway. Maximal gene induction was found after 2 h of light stimulation (1432 genes), and this included the opsin gene opblue and the core clock genes cry2 and npas2. Pathway and cluster analyses revealed light activation of glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission, including CREB and AP-1 transcription pathway signaling. This suggests that circadian photic entrainment in Nasonia may require pathways that are similar to those in mammals. We propose a model for hymenopteran circadian light-resetting that involves opsin-based photoreception, glutamatergic neurotransmission, and gene induction of cry2 and npas2 to reset the circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Orofacial cleft (OC) is a common congenital anomaly in humans, which has lifelong implications for affected individuals. This disorder can be classified as syndromic or non-syndromic depending on the presence or absence of additional physical or neurodevelopmental abnormalities, respectively. Non-syndromic cleft is often non-familial in nature and has a complex aetiology, whereas syndromic forms tend to be monogenic. Although individual OC-related syndromes have been frequently described in the medical literature, there has not been a comprehensive review across syndromes, thereby leaving a gap in our knowledge, which this paper aims to address. Six hundred and three patients with cleft-related human phenotype ontology terms were identified within the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study. Genes carrying pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified and reviewed enabling a diagnostic yield of 36.5\%. In total, 124 candidate genes for syndromic OC were identified, including 34 new genes that should be considered for inclusion in clinical clefting panels. Functional enrichment and gene expression analyses identified three key processes that were significantly overrepresented in syndromic OC gene lists: embryonic morphogenesis, protein stability and chromatin organization. Comparison with non-syndromic OC gene networks led us to propose that chromatin remodelling specifically contributes to the aetiology of syndromic OC. Disease-driven gene discovery is a valid approach to gene identification and curation of gene panels. Through this approach, we have started to unravel common molecular pathways contributing to syndromic orofacial clefting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed "Enrichment Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results.
CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

Long annotation lists and redundancy also complicate the comparison of results obtained from different enrichment analyses.

However, down-sized collections are generic and the level of detail may not fit the user’s study. Other available approaches include clustering and filtering tools, which are based on similarity measures and thresholds that can be complicated to comprehend and set.},

Bioinformatic methods, including functional enrichment and network analysis, can provide information about the underlying molecular mechanisms that participate in the progression of osteoporosis. In this study, we harvested human OC-like cells differentiated in culture and their precursor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and characterised the transcriptome of the two cell types using RNA-sequencing in order to identify differentially expressed genes. Differential gene expression analysis was performed in RStudio using the edgeR package. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify enriched GO terms and signalling pathways, with inter-connected regions characterised using protein–protein interaction analysis. In this study, we identified 3201 differentially expressed genes using a 5\% false discovery rate; 1834 genes were upregulated, whereas 1367 genes were downregulated. We confirmed a significant upregulation of several well-established OC genes including CTSK, DCSTAMP, ACP5, MMP9, ITGB3, and ATP6V0D2. The GO analysis suggested that upregulated genes are involved in cell division, cell migration, and cell adhesion, while the KEGG pathway analysis highlighted oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, lysosome, and focal adhesion pathways. This study provides new information about changes in gene expression and highlights key biological pathways involved in osteoclastogenesis.},

	abstract = {Metabolites are low molecular-weight molecules produced during cellular metabolism. The global expression of the meta-metabolome (metabolomics at the community level) could thus potentially be used to characterize the exposure of an organism or a community to a specific stressor. Here, the meta-metabolomic fingerprints of mature biofilms were examined after 1, 3 and 7 days of exposure to five concentrations of cobalt (0, 1 x 10-7, 1 x 10-6, 5 x 10-6 and 1 x 10-5 M) in aquatic microcosms. The global changes in meta-metabolomic fingerprints were in good agreement with those of the other biological parameters studied (cobalt bioaccumulation, biomass, chlorophyll content). To better understand the dose-responses of the biofilm meta-metabolome, the untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomic data were further processed using the DRomics tool to build dose-response model curves and to calculate benchmark doses (BMD). These BMDs were aggregated into an empirical cumulative density function. A trend analysis of the metabolite dose-response curves suggests the presence of a concentration range inducing defense mechanisms (CRIDeM) between 4.7 x 10-7 and 2.7 x 10-6 M, and of a concentration range inducing damage mechanisms (CRIDaM) from 2.7 x 10-6 M to the highest Co concentration. The present study demonstrates that the molecular defense and damage mechanisms can be related to contaminant concentrations and represent a promising approach for environmental risk assessment of metals.

	abstract = {Background
Oxidative stress is one of the main factors in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE). Many genes and molecular pathways play a role in its occurrence, however, so far no study has been conducted with a bioinformatics approach to identify genes. Therefore, we investigated this issue in this study.
Material and methods
In this study, microarray data (GSE30186 dataset) sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed. This dataset consists of 12 placental tissue samples; six was obtained from normal individuals and six from patients diagnosed with preeclampsia. Differential gene analysis was conducted with the LIMMA package in R software using the following criteria 1: absolute log fold change {\textgreater}1, 2: adjusted P-value {\textless}0.05. Oxidative stress-related genes were sourced from Genecard, and the overlap with DEGs was extracted via a Venn diagram. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were performed using Enrichr software. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was designed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape. Hub genes were identified using various methods. Associations between hub genes, transcription factors, and microRNAs were assessed using the miRTarBase and TRRUST databases. Hub gene validation was conducted on the GSE75010 dataset, which comprises 80 preeclampsia and 77 control placenta samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test (P {\textless} 0.05); boxplots were also generated for visualization.
Result
Analysis of the GSE30186 dataset identified 717 DEGs in PE compared to normal samples with 448 upregulated and 269 downregulated DEGs. To investigate oxidative stress in PE, a list of 391 genes related to oxidative stress was initially collected from Genecard. Subsequently, an intersection was identified between these oxidative stress-related genes and DEGs, resulting in the identification of 26 shared genes between the DEGs and the oxidative stress-related genes. PPI network and hub gene analyses identified 8 hub genes, including STAT1, SERPINE1, CXCL8, and FN1. According to the results, hsa-miR-146a-5p has the most interactions with hub genes among miRNAs, and RELA has the most interactions among TFs. Finally, validation using the GSE75010 dataset confirmed significant differential expression of SERPINE1, CXCL8, and FN1 in PE; it suggested cited genes as hub genes, while STAT1 did not exhibit significant differences.
Conclusion
Identifying pathways related to the expression of hub genes can be useful in designing appropriate treatment strategies. On the other hand, examining the pathways activated by hub genes can be effective in preventing ROS production.},

	abstract = {Enrichment analysis (EA) is a common approach to gain functional insights from genome-scale experiments. As a consequence, a large number of EA methods have been developed, yet it is unclear from previous studies which method is the best for a given dataset. The main issues with previous benchmarks include the complexity of correctly assigning true pathways to a test dataset, and lack of generality of the evaluation metrics, for which the rank of a single target pathway is commonly used.
We here provide a generalized EA benchmark and apply it to the most widely used EA methods, representing all four categories of current approaches. The benchmark employs a new set of 82 curated gene expression datasets from DNA microarray and RNA-Seq experiments for 26 diseases, of which only 13 are cancers. In order to address the shortcomings of the single target pathway approach and to enhance the sensitivity evaluation, we present the Disease Pathway Network, in which related KEGG pathways are linked. We introduce a novel approach to evaluate pathway EA by combining sensitivity and specificity to provide a balanced evaluation of EA methods. This approach identifies Network Enrichment Analysis methods as the overall top performers compared to overlap-based methods. By using randomized gene expression datasets, we explore the null hypothesis bias of each method, revealing that most of them produce skewed p-values.},

In this paper, we propose two algorithms, termed NetPEA and NetPEA’, for conducting network-based pathway enrichment analysis. Our algorithms consider not only shared genes but also gene–gene interactions. Both algorithms utilize a protein–protein interaction network and a random walk with a restart procedure to identify hidden relationships between an input gene set and pathways, but both use different randomization strategies to evaluate statistical significance and as a result emphasize different pathway properties. Compared to an over representation-based method, our algorithms can identify more statistically significant pathways. Compared to an existing network-based algorithm, EnrichNet, our algorithms have a higher sensitivity in revealing the true causal pathways while at the same time achieving a higher specificity. A literature review of selected results indicates that some of the novel pathways reported by our algorithms are biologically relevant and important. While the evaluations are performed only with KEGG pathways, we believe the algorithms can be valuable for general functional discovery from high-throughput experiments.},

This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.Availability: topgo.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.deContact:  alexa@mpi-sb.mpg.deSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The advancement and dropping costs of RNA sequencing, accompanied by more available reference genomes for different species, make transcriptome analysis in non-model organisms possible. Current obstacles in analyzing RNA-seq data include a lack of functional annotation, which may complicate the process of linking genes to corresponding functions. Here, we provide a one-stop RNA-seq analysis pipeline, PipeOne-NM, for transcriptome functional annotation, non-coding RNA identification, and transcripts alternative splicing analysis of non-model organisms, intended for use with Illumina platform-based RNA-seq data. We performed PipeOne-NM on 237 Schmidtea mediterranea RNA-seq runs and assembled a transcriptome with 84,827 sequences from 49,320 genes, identifying 64,582 mRNA from 35,485 genes, 20,217 lncRNA from 17,084 genes, and 3481 circRNAs from 1103 genes. In addition, we performed a co-expression analysis of lncRNA and mRNA and identified that 1319 lncRNA co-express with at least one mRNA. Further analysis of samples from S. mediterranea sexual and asexual strains revealed the role of sexual reproduction in gene expression profiles. Samples from different parts of asexual S. mediterranea revealed that differential expression profiles of different body parts correlated with the function of conduction of nerve impulses. In conclusion, PipeOne-NM has the potential to provide comprehensive transcriptome information for non-model organisms on a single platform.},

	abstract = {Background
A variety of high-throughput analyses, such as transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analysis, have been developed, producing unprecedented amounts of omics data. These studies generate large gene lists, of which the biological significance shall be deeply understood. However, manually interpreting these lists is difficult, especially for non-bioinformatics-savvy scientists.

Results
We developed an R package and a corresponding web server—Genekitr, to assist biologists in exploring large gene sets. Genekitr comprises four modules: gene information retrieval, ID (identifier) conversion, enrichment analysis and publication-ready plotting. Currently, the information retrieval module can retrieve information on up to 23 attributes for genes of 317 organisms. The ID conversion module assists in ID-mapping of genes, probes, proteins, and aliases. The enrichment analysis module organizes 315 gene set libraries in different biological contexts by over-representation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. The plotting module performs customizable and high-quality illustrations that can be used directly in presentations or publications.

Conclusions
This web server tool will make bioinformatics more accessible to scientists who might not have programming expertise, allowing them to perform bioinformatics tasks without coding.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are frequently applied to describe the dynamics of signaling in living cells. In systems biology, ODE models are typically defined by translating relevant biochemical interactions into rate equations. The advantage of such {\textless}italic{\textgreater}mechanistic{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} models is that each dynamic variable and model parameter has its counterpart in the biological process which potentiates interpretations and enables biologically relevant conclusions. A disadvantage for such mechanistic dynamic models is, however, that they become very large with respect to the number of dynamic variables and parameters if entire cellular pathways are described. Moreover, analytical solutions of the ODEs are not available and the dynamics is nonlinear which proves to be challenging for numerical approaches as well as for statistically valid reasoning. Here, a complementary modeling approach based on curve fitting of a tailored {\textless}italic{\textgreater}retarded transient function (RTF){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is introduced which exhibits amazing capabilities in approximating ODE solutions in case of transient dynamics as it is typically observed for cellular signaling pathways. A benefit of the suggested RTF is the feasibility of self-explanatory interpretations of the parameters as response time, as amplitudes, and time constants of a transient and a sustained part of the response. In order to demonstrate the performance of this approach in realistic systems biology settings, nine benchmark problems for cellular signaling have been analyzed. The presented approach can serve as an alternative modeling approach of individual time courses for large systems in the case of few observables. Moreover, it not only facilitates the interpretation of the model response of traditional ODE models, but also offers a data-driven strategy for predicting the approximate dynamic responses by an explicit function that, in addition, facilitates subsequent analytical calculations. Thus, it constitutes a promising complementary mathematical modeling strategy for situations where classical ODE modeling is cumbersome or even infeasible.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The generation and interpretation of results from transcriptome profiling experiments via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be a complex task. While raw data quality control, alignment, and quantification can be streamlined via efficient algorithms that can deliver the preprocessed expression matrix, a common bottleneck in the analysis of such large datasets is the subsequent in-depth, iterative processes of data exploration, statistical testing, visualization, and interpretation. Specific tools for these workflow steps are available but require a level of technical expertise which might be prohibitive for life and clinical scientists, who are left with essential pieces of information distributed among different tabular and list formats. Our protocols are centered on the joint use of our Bioconductor packages (pcaExplorer, ideal, GeneTonic) for interactive and reproducible workflows. All our packages provide an interactive and accessible experience via Shiny web applications, while still documenting the steps performed with RMarkdown as a framework to guarantee the reproducibility of the analyses, reducing the overall time to generate insights from the data at hand. These protocols guide readers through the essential steps of Exploratory Data Analysis, statistical testing, and functional enrichment analyses, followed by integration and contextualization of results. In our packages, the core elements are linked together in interactive widgets that make drill-down tasks efficient by viewing the data at a level of increased detail. Thanks to their interoperability with essential classes and gold-standard pipelines implemented in the open-source Bioconductor project and community, these protocols will permit complex tasks in RNA-seq data analysis, combining interactivity and reproducibility for following modern best scientific practices and helping to streamline the discovery process for transcriptome data. © 2022 The Authors.

With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.},

The FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles provide practical guidelines for maximizing the value of research data; however, processing data using workflows—systematic executions of a series of computational tools—is equally important for good data management. The FAIR principles have recently been adapted to Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) to promote the reproducibility and reusability of any type of research software. Here, we propose a set of 10 quick tips, drafted by experienced workflow developers that will help researchers to apply FAIR4RS principles to workflows. The tips have been arranged according to the FAIR acronym, clarifying the purpose of each tip with respect to the FAIR4RS principles. Altogether, these tips can be seen as practical guidelines for workflow developers who aim to contribute to more reproducible and sustainable computational science, aiming to positively impact the open science and FAIR community.},

	abstract = {Transcriptomics is widely used to assess the state of biological systems. There are many tools for the different steps, such as normalization, differential expression, and enrichment. While numerous studies have examined the impact of method choices on differential expression results, little attention has been paid to their effects on further downstream functional analysis, which typically provides the basis for interpretation and follow-up experiments. To address this, we introduce FLOP, a comprehensive nextflow-based workflow combining methods to perform end-to-end analyses of transcriptomics data. We illustrate FLOP on datasets ranging from end-stage heart failure patients to cancer cell lines. We discovered effects not noticeable at the gene-level, and observed that not filtering the data had the highest impact on the correlation between pipelines in the gene set space. Moreover, we performed three benchmarks to evaluate the 12 pipelines included in FLOP, and confirmed that filtering is essential in scenarios of expected moderate-to-low biological signal. Overall, our results underscore the impact of carefully evaluating the consequences of the choice of preprocessing methods on downstream enrichment analyses. We envision FLOP as a valuable tool to measure the robustness of functional analyses, ultimately leading to more reliable and conclusive biological findings.},

While most data integration approaches focus on aligning metadata, data integration can be achieved by abstracting experimental results into gene sets. Such gene sets can be made available for reuse through gene set enrichment analysis tools such as Enrichr. Enrichr currently only supports gene sets compiled from human and mouse, limiting accessibility for investigators that study other model organisms. modEnrichr is an expansion of Enrichr for four model organisms: fish, fly, worm and yeast. The gene set libraries within FishEnrichr, FlyEnrichr, WormEnrichr and YeastEnrichr are created from the Gene Ontology, mRNA expression profiles, GeneRIF, pathway databases, protein domain databases and other organism-specific resources. Additionally, libraries were created by predicting gene function from RNA-seq co-expression data processed uniformly from the gene expression omnibus for each organism. The modEnrichr suite of tools provides the ability to convert gene lists across species using an ortholog conversion tool that automatically detects the species. For complex analyses, modEnrichr provides API access that enables submitting batch queries. In summary, modEnrichr leverages existing model organism databases and other resources to facilitate comprehensive hypothesis generation through data integration.},

Melanin synthesis is the result of a complex network of signaling and metabolic reactions. It therefore comes as no surprise that mutations in many of the genes involved are associated with various types of pigmentation diseases and phenotypes (‘pigmentation genes’). Here, we used bioinformatics tools to first reconstruct gene-disease/phenotype associations for all pigmentation genes. Next, we reconstructed protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks centered around pigmentation gene products (‘pigmentation proteins’) and supplemented the PPI networks with protein expression information obtained by mass spectrometry in a panel of melanoma cell lines (both pigment producing and non-pigment producing cells). The analysis provides a systems network representation of all genes/ proteins centered around pigmentation and melanin biosynthesis pathways (‘pigmentation network map’). Our work will enable the pigmentation research community to experimentally test new hypothesis arising from the pigmentation network map and to identify new targets for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {R-loops play versatile roles in many physiological and pathological processes, and are of great interest to scientists in multiple fields. However, controversy about their genomic localization and incomplete understanding of their regulatory network raise great challenges for R-loop research. Here, we present R-loopBase (https://rloopbase.nju.edu.cn) to tackle these pressing issues by systematic integration of genomics and literature data. First, based on 107 high-quality genome-wide R-loop mapping datasets generated by 11 different technologies, we present a reference set of human R-loop zones for high-confidence R-loop localization, and spot conservative genomic features associated with R-loop formation. Second, through literature mining and multi-omics analyses, we curate the most comprehensive list of R-loop regulatory proteins and their targeted R-loops in multiple species to date. These efforts help reveal a global regulatory network of R-loop dynamics and its potential links to the development of cancers and neurological diseases. Finally, we integrate billions of functional genomic annotations, and develop interactive interfaces to search, visualize, download and analyze R-loops and R-loop regulators in a well-annotated genomic context. R-loopBase allows all users, including those with little bioinformatics background to utilize these data for their own research. We anticipate R-loopBase will become a one-stop resource for the R-loop community.},

	abstract = {Protein networks have become a popular tool for analyzing and visualizing the often long lists of proteins or genes obtained from proteomics and other high-throughput technologies. One of the most popular sources of such networks is the STRING database, which provides protein networks for more than 2000 organisms, including both physical interactions from experimental data and functional associations from curated pathways, automatic text mining, and prediction methods. However, its web interface is mainly intended for inspection of small networks and their underlying evidence. The Cytoscape software, on the other hand, is much better suited for working with large networks and offers greater flexibility in terms of network analysis, import, and visualization of additional data. To include both resources in the same workflow, we created stringApp, a Cytoscape app that makes it easy to import STRING networks into Cytoscape, retains the appearance and many of the features of STRING, and integrates data from associated databases. Here, we introduce many of the stringApp features and show how they can be used to carry out complex network analysis and visualization tasks on a typical proteomics data set, all through the Cytoscape user interface. stringApp is freely available from the Cytoscape app store: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp .},

	abstract = {Markov Clustering (MCL) is a popular algorithm for clustering networks in bioinformatics such as protein-protein interaction networks and protein similarity networks. An important requirement when clustering protein networks is minimizing the number of big clusters, since it is generally understood that protein complexes tend not to have more than 15--30 nodes. Similarly, it is important to not output too many singleton clusters, since they do not provide much useful information. In this paper, we show how MCL may be modified so as to better respect these two requirements, while also taking the link structure in the graph into account. We design our algorithm on top of Regularized MCL (R-MCL) [16], a previously proposed modification of MCL. Our proposed variation computes a new regularization matrix at each iteration that penalizes big cluster sizes, with the size of the penalty being tunable using a balance parameter. This algorithm also naturally fits in a Multi level framework that allows great improvements in speed. We perform experiments on three real protein interaction networks and show significant improvements over MCL in quality, balance and execution speed.},

While many libraries and packages exist that implement various algorithms, there remains the need for clustering packages that are easy to use, integrated with visualization of the results, and integrated with other commonly used tools for biological data analysis. clusterMaker2 has added several new algorithms, including two entirely new categories of analyses: node ranking and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, many of the new algorithms have been implemented using the Cytoscape jobs API, which provides a mechanism for executing remote jobs from within Cytoscape. Together, these advances facilitate meaningful analyses of modern biological datasets despite their ever-increasing size and complexity.},

Using the context of transcriptional regulation by steroid hormone receptors, this review focuses on gene-specific actions of coregulators and evidence linking individual coregulators with specific physiological pathways.

However, how TFs achieve combinatorial enhancer control and how enhancers, enhancer-bound TFs, and the cofactors they recruit regulate RNA Polymerase II activity is not entirely clear. Here, we review how TF synergy is mediated at the level of DNA binding and after binding, the role of cofactors and the post-translational modifications they catalyze, and discuss different models of enhancer—core-promoter communication.},

Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species.,  With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data. RNfuzzyApp offers several methods for normalization and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, providing easy-to-use toolboxes, interactive plots and downloadable results. For time-series analysis, RNfuzzyApp presents the first web-based, fully automated pipeline for soft clustering with the Mfuzz R package, including methods to aid in cluster number selection, cluster overlap analysis, Mfuzz loop computations, as well as cluster enrichments.,  RNfuzzyApp is an intuitive, easy to use and interactive R shiny app for RNA-seq differential expression and time-series analysis, offering a rich selection of interactive plots, providing a quick overview of raw data and generating rapid analysis results. Furthermore, its assignment of orthologs, enrichment analysis, as well as ID conversion functions are accessible to non-model organisms.},

Yet, the ever-growing types of molecules and regulatory mechanisms being discovered have been persistently transforming our understandings on the cellular machinery. This renders cell omics seemingly, like the universe, expand with no limit and our goal toward the complete harness of the cellular system merely impossible. Therefore, it is imperative to review what has been done and is being done to predict what can be done toward the translation of omics information to disease control with minimal cell perturbation. With a focus on the “four big omics,” i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, we delineate hierarchies of these omics together with their epiomics and interactomics, and review technologies developed for interrogation. We predict, among others, redoxomics as an emerging omics layer that views cell decision toward the physiological or pathological state as a fine-tuned redox balance.},

Since the latest update of the database, the availability of source data has improved drastically, and user expectations on a tool for functional associations have grown. To meet these requirements, we have made a new release of FunCoup with updated source data and improved functionality. FunCoup 5 now includes 22 species from all domains of life, and the source data for evidences, gold standards, and genomes have been updated to the latest available versions. In this new release, directed regulatory links inferred from transcription factor binding can be visualized in the network viewer for the human interactome. Another new feature is the possibility to filter by genes expressed in a certain tissue in the network viewer. FunCoup 5 further includes the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, allowing users to visualize and analyze interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins in order to better understand COVID-19.

By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning {\textasciitilde}350 million years of evolution, we observed significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in primates. Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed. However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators.

	abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for `soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the `weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its `unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

Here we provide a more integrated view of human brain evolution by examining the large-scale organization of gene coexpression networks in human and chimpanzee brains. We identify modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to discrete brain regions and quantify their conservation between the species. Module conservation in cerebral cortex is significantly weaker than module conservation in subcortical brain regions, revealing a striking gradient that parallels known evolutionary hierarchies. We introduce a method for identifying species-specific network connections and demonstrate how differential network connectivity can be used to identify key drivers of evolutionary change. By integrating our results with comparative genomic sequence data and estimates of protein sequence divergence rates, we confirm a number of network predictions and validate these findings.

Although some salt responsive genes have been identified in rice, their applications in developing salt tolerant cultivars have resulted in limited achievements. Herein, we used bioinformatic approaches to perform a meta-analysis of three transcriptome datasets from salinity and control conditions in order to reveal novel genes and the molecular pathways underlying rice response to salt. From a total of 28,432 expressed genes, we identify 457 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) constitutively responding to salt, regardless of the stress duration, genotype, or the tissue. Gene co-expression analysis divided the core DEGs into three different modules, each of them contributing to salt response in a unique metabolic pathway. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses highlighted key biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the salt response. We identified important novel hub genes encoding proteins of different families including CAM, DUF630/632, DUF581, CHL27, PP2-13, LEA4-5, and transcription factors, which could be functionally characterized using reverse genetic experiments. This novel repertoire of candidate genes related to salt response in rice will be useful for engineering salt tolerant varieties.},

The analysis of RNA-seq data at four different levels (samples, genes, transcripts, and exons) involve multiple statistical and computational questions, some of which remain challenging up to date. Results We review RNA-seq analysis tools at the sample, gene, transcript, and exon levels from a statistical perspective. We also highlight the biological and statistical questions of most practical considerations. Conclusions The development of statistical and computational methods for analyzing RNA-seq data has made significant advances in the past decade. However, methods developed to answer the same biological question often rely on diverse statistical models and exhibit different performance under different scenarios. This review discusses and compares multiple commonly used statistical models regarding their assumptions, in the hope of helping users select appropriate methods as needed, as well as assisting developers for future method development.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Using FunRich, users can perform functional enrichment analysis on background databases that are integrated from heterogeneous genomic and proteomic resources ({\textgreater}1.5 million annotations). Besides default human specific FunRich database, users can download data from the UniProt database, which currently supports 20 different taxonomies against which enrichment analysis can be performed. Moreover, the users can build their own custom databases and perform the enrichment analysis irrespective of organism. In addition to proteomics datasets, the custom database allows for the tool to be used for genomics, lipidomics and metabolomics datasets. Thus, FunRich allows for complete database customization and thereby permits for the tool to be exploited as a skeleton for enrichment analysis irrespective of the data type or organism used. FunRich (http://www.funrich.org) is user-friendly and provides graphical representation (Venn, pie charts, bar graphs, column, heatmap and doughnuts) of the data with customizable font, scale and color (publication quality).},

The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface.

	abstract = {The increasing number of OMICs studies demands bioinformatic tools that aid in the analysis of large sets of genes or proteins to understand their roles in the cell and establish functional networks and pathways. In the last decade, over-representation or enrichment tools have played a successful role in the functional analysis of large gene/protein lists, which is evidenced by thousands of publications citing these tools. However, in most cases the results of these analyses are long lists of biological terms associated to proteins that are difficult to digest and interpret. Here we present NeVOmics, Network-based Visualization for Omics, a functional enrichment analysis tool that identifies statistically over-represented biological terms within a given gene/protein set. This tool provides a hypergeometric distribution test to calculate significantly enriched biological terms, and facilitates analysis on cluster distribution and relationship of proteins to processes and pathways. NeVOmics is adapted to use updated information from the two main annotation databases: Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). NeVOmics compares favorably to other Gene Ontology and enrichment tools regarding coverage in the identification of biological terms. NeVOmics can also build different network-based graphical representations from the enrichment results, which makes it an integrative tool that greatly facilitates interpretation of results obtained by OMICs approaches.

	abstract = {Background
The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG, Reactome and ConsensusPathDB, has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets. Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy.

Results
We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100\% of the genes in the original data set with 74\% less redundancy, or 95\% of the genes with 88\% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place.

Conclusion
Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.

	abstract = {Unparalleled technological advances have fueled an explosive growth in the scope and scale of biological data and have propelled life sciences into the realm of “Big Data” that cannot be managed or analyzed by conventional approaches. Big Data in the life sciences are driven primarily via a diverse collection of ‘omics’-based technologies, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and lipidomics. Gene-set enrichment analysis is a powerful approach for interrogating large ‘omics’ datasets, leading to the identification of biological mechanisms associated with observed outcomes. While several factors influence the results from such analysis, the impact from the contents of pathway databases is often under-appreciated. Pathway databases often contain variously named pathways that overlap with one another to varying degrees. Ignoring such redundancies during pathway analysis can lead to the designation of several pathways as being significant due to high content-similarity, rather than truly independent biological mechanisms. Statistically, such dependencies also result in correlated p values and overdispersion, leading to biased results. We investigated the level of redundancies in multiple pathway databases and observed large discrepancies in the nature and extent of pathway overlap. This prompted us to develop the application, ReCiPa (Redundancy Control in Pathway Databases), to control redundancies in pathway databases based on user-defined thresholds. Analysis of genomic and genetic datasets, using ReCiPa-generated overlap-controlled versions of KEGG and Reactome pathways, led to a reduction in redundancy among the top-scoring gene-sets and allowed for the inclusion of additional gene-sets representing possibly novel biological mechanisms. Using obesity as an example, bioinformatic analysis further demonstrated that gene-sets identified from overlap-controlled pathway databases show stronger evidence of prior association to obesity compared to pathways identified from the original databases.},

	abstract = {The study of biological pathways is key to a large number of systems analyses. However, many relevant tools consider a limited number of pathway sources, missing out on many genes and gene-to-gene connections. Simply pooling several pathways sources would result in redundancy and the lack of systematic pathway interrelations. To address this, we exercised a combination of hierarchical clustering and nearest neighbor graph representation, with judiciously selected cutoff values, thereby consolidating 3215 human pathways from 12 sources into a set of 1073 SuperPaths. Our unification algorithm finds a balance between reducing redundancy and optimizing the level of pathway-related informativeness for individual genes. We show a substantial enhancement of the SuperPaths’ capacity to infer gene-to-gene relationships when compared with individual pathway sources, separately or taken together. Further, we demonstrate that the chosen 12 sources entail nearly exhaustive gene coverage. The computed SuperPaths are presented in a new online database, PathCards, showing each SuperPath, its constituent network of pathways, and its contained genes. This provides researchers with a rich, searchable systems analysis resource.Database URL:

	abstract = {The Scientific Committee (SC) reconfirms that the benchmark dose (BMD) approach is a scientifically more advanced method compared to the NOAEL approach for deriving a Reference Point (RP). Most of the modifications made to the SC guidance of 2009 concern the section providing guidance on how to apply the BMD approach. Model averaging is recommended as the preferred method for calculating the BMD confidence interval, while acknowledging that the respective tools are still under development and may not be easily accessible to all. Therefore, selecting or rejecting models is still considered as a suboptimal alternative. The set of default models to be used for BMD analysis has been reviewed, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) has been introduced instead of the log-likelihood to characterise the goodness of fit of different mathematical models to a dose–response data set. A flowchart has also been inserted in this update to guide the reader step-by-step when performing a BMD analysis, as well as a chapter on the distributional part of dose–response models and a template for reporting a BMD analysis in a complete and transparent manner. Finally, it is recommended to always report the BMD confidence interval rather than the value of the BMD. The lower bound (BMDL) is needed as a potential RP, and the upper bound (BMDU) is needed for establishing the BMDU/BMDL per ratio reflecting the uncertainty in the BMD estimate. This updated guidance does not call for a general re-evaluation of previous assessments where the NOAEL approach or the BMD approach as described in the 2009 SC guidance was used, in particular when the exposure is clearly smaller (e.g. more than one order of magnitude) than the health-based guidance value. Finally, the SC firmly reiterates to reconsider test guidelines given the expected wide application of the BMD approach.},
